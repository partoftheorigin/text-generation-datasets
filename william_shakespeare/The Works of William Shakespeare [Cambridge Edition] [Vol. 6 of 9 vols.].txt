PREFACE.


1. 'The Famous History of the Life of KING HENRY THE EIGHT' was printed
for the first time in the Folio of 1623.

2. The earliest edition of 'TROILUS AND CRESSIDA' of which we have any
knowledge was the Quarto which was printed in 1609 with the following
title:

    The | Historie of Troylus | and Cresseida. | _As it was acted
    by the Kings Maiesties_ | seruants at the Globe. | _Written
    by_ William Shakespeare. | LONDON | Imprinted by _G. Eld_ for
    _R. Bonian_ and _H. Walley_, and | are to be sold at the spred
    Eagle in Paules | Church-yeard, ouer against the | great North
    doore. | 1609. |

In the same year was issued another edition, printed from the same form
as the preceding, but with the following title:

    The | Famous Historie of | Troylus _and_ Cresseid. |
    _Excellently expressing the beginning_ | of their loues, with
    the conceited wooing | of _Pandarus_ Prince of _Licia_. |
    _Written by_ William Shakespeare. | LONDON | Imprinted by _G.
    Eld_ for _R. Bonian_ and _H. Walley_, and | are to be sold at
    the spred Eagle in Paules | Church-yeard, ouer against the |
    great North doore. | 1609. |

Besides the variations in the title-page this edition differs from the
preceding in having a preface, apparently the work of the publisher,
of which the heading is 'A neuer writer, to an euer reader. Newes.'
In this preface the play is called a new one, 'neuer stal'd with the
Stage, neuer clapper-clawd with the palmes of the vulger,' and hence
it has been inferred that the edition with the preface is the earlier
of the two. It appears, however, upon a close examination, that all
the copies were printed from the same form, that the title which we
have recorded first was the original one, and that in some copies
this was cancelled, and the new title and preface inserted on a new
half-sheet and with a new signature. The title-page of the edition with
the preface is printed from the same form as the other title-page, as
is evident from a comparison of the parts in each, from 'Written by
William Shakespeare' to the end, which are absolutely identical. As
the running title, 'The history of Troylus and Cresseida' corresponds
with the first quoted title-page, we believe that the copies with this
title-page were first issued for the theatre, and afterwards those with
the new title-page and preface for general readers. In this case the
expression 'neuer stal'd with the Stage, neuer clapper-clawd with the
palmes of the vulger' must refer to the first appearance of the play in
type, unless we suppose that the publisher was more careful to say what
would recommend his book than to state what was literally true.

Since, in the play itself, these two editions are identical, we refer
to them by one symbol, Q.

It appears from an entry in the Stationers' Registers, 7 Feb. 1602/3,
that a play called 'Troilus and Cressida' had been acted by the Lord
Chamberlain's Servants, and this Mr Staunton conjectures may have
been the same as that upon which Decker and Chettle are known, from
Henslowe's _Diary_, to have been engaged in 1599, and may possibly have
formed the foundation of the later play.

In the Folio of 1623, TROILUS AND CRESSIDA stands between the Histories
and the Tragedies. The Tragedies at first began with _Coriolanus_. Then
followed _Titus Andronicus_ and _Romeo and Juliet_, and it appears upon
examination that the editors intended _Troilus and Cressida_ to be next
in order. With this view the first three pages were actually printed
and paged so as to follow _Romeo and Juliet_, and the play was called
'The Tragedie of Troylus and Cressida.' Whether it was found that the
title of tragedy could not with propriety be given to it, or whatever
may have been the cause, the editors changed its position, cancelled
the leaf containing the end of _Romeo and Juliet_ on one side and the
beginning of _Troilus and Cressida_ on the other, but retained the
other leaf already printed, and then added the prologue to fill up the
blank page, which in the original setting of the type had been occupied
by the end of _Romeo and Juliet_. The rest of the play was printed with
a new set of signatures and without any pagination, and was simply
called 'Troylus and Cressida.'

There are very remarkable discrepancies between the Quarto and the
Folio text of this play, similar in character to those which are found
on comparing the two texts of _Richard III_. In the present case,
however, they are not nearly so frequent, nor, as a general rule, so
important. Some of the most important have been mentioned specially
in the notes at the end of the play, and all the others recorded in
the foot-notes. We find in the Folio several passages essential to
the sense of the context which do not exist in the Quarto, and which
therefore must have been omitted by the negligence of a copyist or
printer. On the other hand we find some passages in the Quarto, not
absolutely essential to the sense, though a decided improvement to
it and quite in the author's manner, which either do not appear in
the Folio at all, or appear in a mutilated form. Sometimes the lines
which are wrongly divided in the Quarto are divided properly in the
Folio, and vice versa: in this point, however, the former is generally
more correct than the latter. The two texts differ in many single
words: sometimes the difference is clearly owing to a clerical or
typographical error, but in other cases it appears to result from
deliberate correction, first by the author himself, and secondly
by some less skilful hand. The main duty of an editor must be to
discriminate the one from the other, and in the first case to prefer
the text of the Folio, and in the second to reject it in favour of the
Quarto. On the whole we are of opinion that the Quarto was printed
from a transcript of the author's original MS.; that this MS. was
afterwards revised and slightly altered by the author himself, and that
before the first Folio was printed from it, it had been tampered with
by another hand. Perhaps the corrections are due to the writer who did
not shrink from prefixing to Shakespeare's play a prologue of his own.

3. CORIOLANUS was first published in the Folio of 1623. The text
abounds with errors, due, probably, to the carelessness or the
illegibility of the transcript from which it was printed.

4. TITUS ANDRONICUS was, so far as we know[A], published for the first
time in the year 1600, in Quarto, with the following title-page:

    The most lamenta-|ble Romaine Tragedie of _Titus_ |
    _Andronicus_. | As it hath sundry times beene playde by the |
    Right Honourable the Earle of Pembrooke, the | Earle of Darbie,
    the Earle of Sussex, and the | Lorde Chamberlaine theyr |
    Seruants. | AT LONDON, | Printed by I. R. for Edward White |
    and are to bee solde at his shoppe, at the little | North doore
    of Paules, at the signe of | the Gun. 1600. |

[A] In the Registers of the Stationers' Company are the following
entries with regard to a book called 'Titus Andronicus,' but it is
more than doubtful whether any of them refer to the editions of the
play of that name which have come down to us. It will be seen that
the entry under the date, 19 April, 1602, speaks of a transference of
copyright from Thomas Millington to Thomas Pavier, but as both the
extant editions of the play, printed respectively in 1600 and 1611,
were published by Edward White, the entry can have reference to neither
of these.

                           6 February, 1593.

              John Danter. Entered for his copye under handes of
                  bothe the wardens a booke intituled, A Noble
                  Roman-Historye of Tytus Andronicus. vjᵈ.

                            1602. 19 April.

              Tho. Pavier. Entred for his copies by assignmᵗ from
                  Thomas Millington these bookes folowing; salvo
                  jure cuiuscumque--

                                  viz.

                  A booke called Thomas of Reading. vjᵈ.

                  The first and second pts of Henry the VIᵗ. ij
                  bookes. xijᵈ.

                  A booke called Titus and Andronic'. vjᵈ.

Under the date 14ᵒ Dec. 1624, among a list of 'Ballades' is mentioned
'Titus and Andronmus.' Again, on 8ᵒ Novemb. 1630, is an entry assigning
to Ric. Cotes from Mr Bird 'all his estate right title and interest in
the Copies hereafter menconed,' and in the list which follows is 'Titus
and Andronicus.' On 4 Aug. 1626, Thomas Pavier had assigned his right
in Titus Andronicus to Edw. Brewster and Rob. Birde, so that apparently
the same book is spoken of here as in the entry under the date 19
April, 1602. This being the case, it is difficult to account for the
fact that a book, which in 1602 was the property of Thomas Millington,
should in 1600 have been printed for Edward White, and that, after
the transference of the copyright from Millington to Pavier, a second
edition of the same book should have been printed in 1611 for the same
Edward White. No edition with Millington's name on the title has yet
been found.

Langbaine, in his _Account of the English Dramatick Poets_, p. 464
(ed. 1691), says of Titus Andronicus, 'This Play was first printed 4ᵒ.
Lond. 1594. and acted by the Earls of Derby, Pembroke, and Essex, their
Servants.' Whether or not this is the same as 'titus and ondronicus'
mentioned in Henslowe's _Diary_ (p. 33, ed. Collier) as acted for the
first time on the 23 Jan. 1593, it is impossible to say.

Only two copies of this edition are known to exist, one in the library
at Bridgewater House, and one in the library of the University of
Edinburgh[B]. From a tracing of the title-page of the latter, kindly
sent us by Mr D. Laing, we find that it agrees in every particular with
the above, which we have copied from the Bridgewater Quarto, now before
us.

[B] _Not_ the Signet Library, as stated by Mr Collier.

For some time the Bridgewater copy was believed to be unique. Todd
was the first to collate it, somewhat hastily as it would seem, with
Steevens' edition of 1793, and the results were given in the notes to
the first variorum edition (1803). Subsequent editors were content to
accept Todd's authority till Mr Collier consulted the original for
himself. Lady Ellesmere's kind liberality has enabled us to do the
like. We have gone over it with great care, and succeeded in recovering
a considerable number of readings which had escaped the notice of
previous collators. Taking its rarity into account, we have recorded
the variations of this edition with unusual minuteness. They are the
better worth notice, as the book is printed with remarkable accuracy.
We call it Q₁.

The second edition of _Titus Andronicus_ was published in 1611. This
we call Q₂. Its title-page is as follows:

    The | most lamen-|table Tragedie | _of Titus Andronicus_. | _As
    it hath sundry_ | _times beene plaide by the Kings_ | Maiesties
    Seruants. | LONDON, | Printed for Eedward White, and are to be
    solde | at his shoppe, nere the little North dore of | Pauls,
    at the signe of the | Gun. 1611. |

This edition was printed from that of 1600, from which it varies only
by some printer's errors and a few conjectural alterations.

The first Folio text was printed from a copy of the second Quarto
which, perhaps, was in the library of the theatre, and had some MS.
alterations and additions made to the stage directions. Here, as
elsewhere, the printer of the Folio has been very careless as to metre.
It is remarkable that the Folio contains a whole scene, Act III. Sc. 2,
not found in the Quartos, but agreeing too closely in style with the
main portion of the play to allow of the supposition that it is due to
a different author. The scene may have been supplied to the players'
copy of Q₂ from a manuscript in their possession.

Ravenscroft's version quoted in our notes is an alteration of the play,
published in 1687 under the title of 'Titus Andronicus: or the Rape of
Lavinia.'

We have to thank Dr Delius of Bonn, for sending us the second edition
of his 'Shakespeare,' and for the interest he has taken in our work,
Dr Leo of Berlin, for a present of his edition of 'Coriolanus,' Mr
Rivington and Mr Greenhill, for procuring us access to the registers of
the Stationers' Company, and Sir S. M. Peto, Sir J. Claridge, Professor
Blackie, Mr D. Laing, the Rev. T. J. Rowsell, Dr Kingsley, Mr R. H.
Martley, Mr L. Booth, and Mr H. Peto, for various acts of kindness.

    I come no more to make you laugh: things now,
    That bear a weighty and a serious brow,
    Sad, high and working, full of state and woe,[1]
    Such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow,
    We now present. Those that can pity, here[2]                       5
    May, if they think it well, let fall a tear;
    The subject will deserve it. Such as give
    Their money out of hope they may believe,
    May here find truth too. Those that come to see
    Only a show or two and so agree[3]                                10
    The play may pass, if they be still and willing,
    I'll undertake may see away their shilling
    Richly in two short hours. Only they
    That come to hear a merry bawdy play,
    A noise of targets, or to see a fellow                            15
    In a long motley coat guarded with yellow,
    Will be deceived; for, gentle hearers, know,
    To rank our chosen truth with such a show
    As fool and fight is, beside forfeiting[4]
    Our own brains and the opinion that we bring                      20
    To make that only true we now intend,[5]
    Will leave us never an understanding friend.[6]
    Therefore, for goodness' sake, and as you are known[7]
    The first and happiest hearers of the town,
    Be sad, as we would make ye: think ye see[8]                      25
    The very persons of our noble story[9]
    As they were living; think you see them great
    And follow'd with the general throng and sweat
    Of thousand friends; then, in a moment, see
    How soon this mightiness meets misery:                            30
    And if you can be merry then, I'll say
    A man may weep upon his wedding-day.

SCENE I. _London. An ante-chamber in the palace._

 _Enter the_ DUKE OF NORFOLK _at one door: at the other, the_ DUKE OF
              BUCKINGHAM _and the_ LORD ABERGAVENNY.[9a]

    _Buck._ Good morrow, and well met. How have ye done
    Since last we saw in France?[10]

    _Nor._                       I thank your grace,
    Healthful, and ever since a fresh admirer
    Of what I saw there.

    _Buck._              An untimely ague
    Stay'd me a prisoner in my chamber when                            5
    Those suns of glory, those two lights of men,[11]
    Met in the vale of Andren.[12]

    _Nor._                     'Twixt Guynes and Arde:
    I was then present, saw them salute on horseback;[13]
    Beheld them, when they 'lighted, how they clung
    In their embracement, as they grew together;                      10
    Which had they, what four throned ones could have weigh'd[14]
    Such a compounded one?

    _Buck._                All the whole time
    I was my chamber's prisoner.

    _Nor._                       Then you lost
    The view of earthly glory: men might say,
    Till this time pomp was single, but now married                   15
    To one above itself. Each following day
    Became the next day's master, till the last[15]
    Made former wonders its. To-day the French,[16]
    All clinquant, all in gold, like heathen gods,[17]
    Shone down the English; and to-morrow they                        20
    Made Britain India: every man that stood
    Show'd like a mine. Their dwarfish pages were
    As cherubins, all gilt: the madams too,
    Not used to toil, did almost sweat to bear
    The pride upon them, that their very labour                       25
    Was to them as a painting: now this masque
    Was cried incomparable; and the ensuing night
    Made it a fool and beggar. The two kings,
    Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
    As presence did present them; him in eye                          30
    Still him in praise; and being present both,
    'Twas said they saw but one, and no discerner
    Durst wag his tongue in censure. When these suns--[18]
    For so they phrase 'em--by their heralds challenged
    The noble spirits to arms, they did perform                       35
    Beyond thought's compass; that former fabulous story,[19]
    Being now seen possible enough, got credit,
    That Bevis was believed.[20]

    _Buck._                  O, you go far.

    _Nor._ As I belong to worship and affect
    In honour honesty, the tract of every thing                       40
    Would by a good discourser lose some life
    Which action's self was tongue to. All was royal;[21][22]
    To the disposing of it nought rebell'd;[22]
    Order gave each thing view; the office did[22][23]
    Distinctly his full function.[22]

    _Buck._                       Who did guide,[22]                  45
    I mean, who set the body and the limbs[22]
    Of this great sport together, as you guess?[22][24]

    _Nor._ One, certes, that promises no element[22][24][25]
    In such a business.[22]

    _Buck._             I pray you, who, my lord?[26]

    _Nor._ All this was order'd by the good discretion                50
    Of the right reverend Cardinal of York.

    _Buck._ The devil speed him! no man's pie is freed
    From his ambitious finger. What had he
    To do in these fierce vanities? I wonder
    That such a keech can with his very bulk[27]                      55
    Take up the rays o' the beneficial sun,
    And keep it from the earth.

    _Nor._                      Surely, sir,[28]
    There's in him stuff that puts him to these ends;
    For, being not propp'd by ancestry, whose grace
    Chalks successors their way, nor call'd upon                      60
    For high feats done to the crown; neither allied
    To eminent assistants; but, spider-like,
    Out of his self-drawing web, he gives us note,[29]
    The force of his own merit makes his way;
    A gift that heaven gives for him, which buys[30]                  65
    A place next to the king.

    _Aber._                   I cannot tell
    What heaven hath given him; let some graver eye
    Pierce into that; but I can see his pride
    Peep through each part of him: whence has he that?[31]
    If not from hell, the devil is a niggard,[31]                     70
    Or has given all before, and he begins
    A new hell in himself.

    _Buck._                Why the devil,[32]
    Upon this French going out, took he upon him,
    Without the privity o' the king, to appoint
    Who should attend on him? He makes up the file                    75
    Of all the gentry; for the most part such[33]
    To whom as great a charge as little honour[33]
    He meant to lay upon: and his own letter,[34][35][36]
    The honourable board of council out,[35][37]
    Must fetch him in he papers.[35][37][38]

    _Aber._                      I do know[35]                        80
    Kinsmen of mine, three at the least, that have
    By this so sicken'd their estates that never[39]
    They shall abound as formerly.

    _Buck._                        O, many
    Have broke their backs with laying manors on 'em[40]
    For this great journey. What did this vanity[41]                  85
    But minister communication of[42]
    A most poor issue?

    _Nor._             Grievingly I think,
    The peace between the French and us not values
    The cost that did conclude it.

    _Buck._                        Every man,
    After the hideous storm that follow'd, was                        90
    A thing inspired, and not consulting broke
    Into a general prophecy: That this tempest,
    Dashing the garment of this peace, aboded
    The sudden breach on't.

    _Nor._                  Which is budded out;
    For France hath flaw'd the league, and hath attach'd              95
    Our merchants' goods at Bourdeaux.[43]

    _Aber._                            Is it therefore
    The ambassador is silenced?

    _Nor._                      Marry, is't.

    _Aber._ A proper title of a peace, and purchased[44]
    At a superfluous rate!

    _Buck._                Why, all this business
    Our reverend cardinal carried.

    _Nor._                         Like it your grace,[45]           100
    The state takes notice of the private difference
    Betwixt you and the cardinal. I advise you--
    And take it from a heart that wishes towards you[46]
    Honour and plenteous safety--that you read
    The cardinal's malice and his potency                            105
    Together; to consider further that
    What his high hatred would effect wants not[47]
    A minister in his power. You know his nature,
    That he's revengeful, and I know his sword
    Hath a sharp edge; it's long and 't may be said                  110
    It reaches far, and where 'twill not extend,
    Thither he darts it. Bosom up my counsel;
    You'll find it wholesome. Lo, where comes that rock
    That I advise your shunning.[48]

    _Enter_ CARDINAL WOLSEY, _the purse borne before him, certain
        of the Guard, and two_ Secretaries _with papers_. _The_
        CARDINAL _in his passage fixeth his eye on_ BUCKINGHAM,
        _and_ BUCKINGHAM _on him, both full of disdain_.

    _Wol._ The Duke of Buckingham's surveyor, ha?[49]                115
    Where's his examination?

    _First Sec._             Here, so please you.[50]

    _Wol._ Is he in person ready?

    _First Sec._                  Ay, please your grace.[51]

    _Wol._ Well, we shall then know more; and Buckingham[52]
    Shall lessen this big look.  [_Exeunt Wolsey and his Train._[52][53]

    _Buck._ This butcher's cur is venom-mouth'd, and I[54]           120
    Have not the power to muzzle him; therefore best
    Not wake him in his slumber. A beggar's book[55]
    Outworths a noble's blood.

    _Nor._                     What, are you chafed?[56]
    Ask God for temperance; that's the appliance only
    Which your disease requires.

    _Buck._                      I read in's looks                   125
    Matter against me, and his eye reviled[57]
    Me as his abject object: at this instant[57]
    He bores me with some trick: he's gone to the king;[58]
    I 'll follow and outstare him.

    _Nor._                         Stay, my lord,
    And let your reason with your choler question                    130
    What 'tis you go about: to climb steep hills
    Requires slow pace at first: anger is like
    A full-hot horse, who being allow'd his way,[59]
    Self-mettle tires him. Not a man in England
    Can advise me like you: be to yourself                           135
    As you would to your friend.

    _Buck._                      I'll to the king;
    And from a mouth of honour quite cry down
    This Ipswich fellow's insolence, or proclaim
    There's difference in no persons.

    _Nor._                            Be advised;
    Heat not a furnace for your foe so hot                           140
    That it do singe yourself: we may outrun,
    By violent swiftness, that which we run at,
    And lose by over-running. Know you not,[60]
    The fire that mounts the liquor till't run o'er
    In seeming to augment it wastes it? Be advised:[61]              145
    I say again, there is no English soul
    More stronger to direct you than yourself,[62]
    If with the sap of reason you would quench,
    Or but allay, the fire of passion.

    _Buck._                            Sir,
    I am thankful to you; and I'll go along                          150
    By your prescription: but this top-proud fellow--
    Whom from the flow of gall I name not but[63]
    From sincere motions--by intelligence
    And proofs as clear as founts in July when[64]
    We see each grain of gravel, I do know                           155
    To be corrupt and treasonous.

    _Nor._                        Say not 'treasonous.'

    _Buck._ To the king I'll say 't; and make my vouch as strong
    As shore of rock. Attend. This holy fox,
    Or wolf, or both--for he is equal ravenous[65][66]
    As he is subtle, and as prone to mischief[65]                    160
    As able to perform't; his mind and place[65]
    Infecting one another, yea, reciprocally--[65]
    Only to show his pomp as well in France
    As here at home, suggests the king our master
    To this last costly treaty, the interview,                       165
    That swallow'd so much treasure, and like a glass
    Did break i' the rinsing.[67]

    _Nor._                    Faith, and so it did.

    _Buck._ Pray, give me favour, sir. This cunning cardinal[68]
    The articles o' the combination drew[69]
    As himself pleased; and they were ratified                       170
    As he cried 'Thus let be,' to as much end[70]
    As give a crutch to the dead: but our count-cardinal[71]
    Has done this, and 'tis well; for worthy Wolsey,
    Who cannot err, he did it. Now this follows--
    Which, as I take it, is a kind of puppy                          175
    To the old dam, treason--Charles the emperor,
    Under pretence to see the queen his aunt--
    For 'twas indeed his colour, but he came
    To whisper Wolsey--here makes visitation:
    His fears were that the interview betwixt                        180
    England and France might through their amity
    Breed him some prejudice; for from this league
    Peep'd harms that menaced him: he privily[72]
    Deals with our cardinal; and, as I trow--[73]
    Which I do well, for I am sure the emperor                       185
    Paid ere he promised; whereby his suit was granted
    Ere it was ask'd--but when the way was made
    And paved with gold, the emperor thus desired,[74]
    That he would please to alter the king's course
    And break the foresaid peace. Let the king know,                 190
    As soon he shall by me, that thus the cardinal
    Does buy and sell his honour as he pleases
    And for his own advantage.[75]

    NOR.                   I am sorry
    To hear this of him, and could wish he were[76]
    Something mistaken in't.

    _Buck._                  No, not a syllable:                     195
    I do pronounce him in that very shape
    He shall appear in proof.

 _Enter_ BRANDON, _a_ Sergeant at arms _before him, and two or three of
                            the_ Guard.[77]

    _Bran._ Your office, sergeant; execute it.

    _Serg._                                    Sir,[78]
    My lord the Duke of Buckingham, and Earl
    Of Hereford, Stafford, and Northampton, I[79]                    200
    Arrest thee of high treason, in the name
    Of our most sovereign king.

    _Buck._                     Lo you, my lord,[80]
    The net has fall'n upon me! I shall perish
    Under device and practice.

    _Bran._                    I am sorry[81]
    To see you ta'en from liberty, to look on[81]                    205
    The business present: 'tis his highness' pleasure[81][82]
    You shall to the Tower.[81]

    _Buck._                 It will help me nothing
    To plead mine innocence; for that dye is on me
    Which makes my whitest part black. The will of heaven
    Be done in this and all things! I obey.                          210
    O my Lord Abergavenny, fare you well![83]

    _Bran._ Nay, he must bear you company. [_To Abergavenny._] The king[84]
    Is pleased you shall to the Tower, till you know
    How he determines further.

    _Aber._                    As the duke said,
    The will of heaven be done, and the king's pleasure              215
    By me obey'd!

    _Bran._       Here is a warrant from
    The king to attach Lord Montacute; and the bodies[85]
    Of the duke's confessor, John de la Car,[86]
    One Gilbert Peck, his chancellor,--[87]

    _Buck._                             So, so;
    These are the limbs o' the plot: no more, I hope.                220

    _Bran._ A monk o' the Chartreux.

    _Buck._                          O, Nicholas Hopkins?[88]

    _Bran._                                               He.

    _Buck._ My surveyor is false; the o'er-great cardinal
    Hath show'd him gold; my life is spann'd already:
    I am the shadow of poor Buckingham,
    Whose figure even this instant cloud puts on,[89][90]            225
    By darkening my clear sun. My lord, farewell.     [_Exeunt._[89][91]


SCENE II. _The same. The council-chamber._

    _Cornets. Enter_ KING HENRY, _leaning on the_ CARDINAL'S
        _shoulder; the Nobles, and_ SIR THOMAS LOVELL: _the_
        CARDINAL _places himself under the_ KING'S _feet on his
        right side_.[92]

    _King._ My life itself, and the best heart of it,
    Thanks you for this great care: I stood i' the level
    Of a full-charged confederacy, and give thanks[93]
    To you that choked it. Let be call'd before us[94]
    That gentleman of Buckingham's; in person[95]                      5
    I'll hear him his confessions justify;
    And point by point the treasons of his master[96]
    He shall again relate.

    _A noise within, crying_ 'Room for the Queen!' _Enter_ QUEEN
        KATHARINE, _ushered by the_ DUKE OF NORFOLK, _and the_ DUKE
        OF SUFFOLK: _she kneels. The_ KING _riseth from his state,
        takes her up, kisses and placeth her by him_.[97]

    _Q. Kath._ Nay, we must longer kneel: I am a suitor.

    _King._ Arise, and take place by us: half your suit[98]           10
    Never name to us; you have half our power:
    The other moiety ere you ask is given;
    Repeat your will and take it.

    _Q. Kath._                    Thank your majesty.
    That you would love yourself, and in that love
    Not unconsider'd leave your honour nor[99]                        15
    The dignity of your office, is the point
    Of my petition.

    _King._         Lady mine, proceed.

    _Q. Kath._ I am solicited, not by a few,[100]
    And those of true condition, that your subjects
    Are in great grievance: there have been commissions               20
    Sent down among 'em, which hath flaw'd the heart[101]
    Of all their loyalties: wherein although,
    My good lord cardinal, they vent reproaches
    Most bitterly on you as putter on
    Of these exactions, yet the king our master--                     25
    Whose honour heaven shield from soil!--even he escapes not
    Language unmannerly, yea, such which breaks
    The sides of loyalty and almost appears[102]
    In loud rebellion.

    NOR.           Not almost appears;
    It doth appear; for, upon these taxations,                        30
    The clothiers all, not able to maintain
    The many to them 'longing, have put off[103]
    The spinsters, carders, fullers, weavers, who,
    Unfit for other life, compell'd by hunger
    And lack of other means, in desperate manner                      35
    Daring the event to the teeth, are all in uproar,
    And danger serves among them.

    _King._                       Taxation!
    Wherein? and what taxation? My lord cardinal,
    You that are blamed for it alike with us,
    Know you of this taxation?

    _Wol._                     Please you, sir,                       40
    I know but of a single part in aught
    Pertains to the state, and front but in that file
    Where others tell steps with me.

    _Q. Kath._                       No, my lord,[104]
    You know no more than others: but you frame[104]
    Things that are known alike, which are not wholesome[105]         45
    To those which would not know them and yet must
    Perforce be their acquaintance. These exactions,
    Whereof my sovereign would have note, they are
    Most pestilent to the hearing; and, to bear 'em,[106]
    The back is sacrifice to the load. They say                       50
    They are devised by you; or else you suffer[107]
    Too hard an exclamation.

    _King._                  Still exaction!
    The nature of it? in what kind, let's know,
    Is this exaction?

    _Q. Kath._        I am much too venturous[108]
    In tempting of your patience, but am bolden'd                     55
    Under your promised pardon. The subjects' grief
    Comes through commissions, which compel from each[109]
    The sixth part of his substance, to be levied
    Without delay; and the pretence for this
    Is named your wars in France: this makes bold mouths:             60
    Tongues spit their duties out, and cold hearts freeze
    Allegiance in them; their curses now[110]
    Live where their prayers did; and it's come to pass,
    This tractable obedience is a slave[111]
    To each incensed will. I would your highness                      65
    Would give it quick consideration, for
    There is no primer business.[112]

    _King._                      By my life,
    This is against our pleasure.

    _Wol._                        And for me,
    I have no further gone in this than by
    A single voice, and that not pass'd me but                        70
    By learned approbation of the judges. If I am[113]
    Traduced by ignorant tongues, which neither know[114]
    My faculties nor person, yet will be
    The chronicles of my doing, let me say
    'Tis but the fate of place and the rough brake                    75
    That virtue must go through. We must not stint
    Our necessary actions, in the fear
    To cope malicious censurers; which ever,
    As ravenous fishes, do a vessel follow
    That is new-trimm'd, but benefit no further                       80
    Than vainly longing. What we oft do best,
    By sick interpreters, once weak ones, is[115]
    Not ours or not allow'd; what worst, as oft,
    Hitting a grosser quality, is cried up
    For our best act. If we shall stand still,[116]                   85
    In fear our motion will be mock'd or carp'd at,[117]
    We should take root here where we sit, or sit[118][119]
    State-statues only.[119]

    _King._             Things done well,[120]
    And with a care, exempt themselves from fear;
    Things done without example, in their issue                       90
    Are to be fear'd. Have you a precedent[121]
    Of this commission? I believe, not any.
    We must not rend our subjects from our laws,
    And stick them in our will. Sixth part of each?
    A trembling contribution! Why, we take[122]                       95
    From every tree lop, bark, and part o' the timber,[123]
    And though we leave it with a root, thus hack'd,[124]
    The air will drink the sap. To every county
    Where this is question'd send our letters, with
    Free pardon to each man that has denied                          100
    The force of this commission: pray, look to't;
    I put it to your care.

    _Wol._                 [_To the Secretary_] A word with you.[125]
    Let there be letters writ to every shire,
    Of the king's grace and pardon. The grieved commons[126]
    Hardly conceive of me: let it be noised                          105
    That through our intercession this revokement
    And pardon comes: I shall anon advise you
    Further in the proceeding.                        [_Exit Secretary._

                           _Enter_ Surveyor.

    _Q. Kath._ I am sorry that the Duke of Buckingham[127]
    Is run in your displeasure.

    _King._                     It grieves many:[128]                110
    The gentleman is learn'd and a most rare speaker;[129]
    To nature none more bound; his training such
    That he may furnish and instruct great teachers
    And never seek for aid out of himself. Yet see,[130]
    When these so noble benefits shall prove[131]                    115
    Not well disposed, the mind growing once corrupt,
    They turn to vicious forms, ten times more ugly
    Than ever they were fair. This man so complete,[132]
    Who was enroll'd 'mongst wonders, and when we,[133]
    Almost with ravish'd listening, could not find[133][134]         120
    His hour of speech a minute; he, my lady,
    Hath into monstrous habits put the graces
    That once were his, and is become as black
    As if besmear'd in hell. Sit by us; you shall hear--[135]
    This was his gentlemen in trust--of him                          125
    Things to strike honour sad. Bid him recount
    The fore-recited practices; whereof[136]
    We cannot feel too little, hear too much.

    _Wol._ Stand forth, and with bold spirit relate what you,
    Most like a careful subject, have collected                      130
    Out of the Duke of Buckingham.

    _King._                        Speak freely.

    _Surv._ First, it was usual with him, every day[137]
    It would infect his speech, that if the king
    Should without issue die, he'll carry it so[138]
    To make the sceptre his: these very words                        135
    I've heard him utter to his son-in-law,
    Lord Abergavenny, to whom by oath he menaced[139]
    Revenge upon the cardinal.

    _Wol._                     Please your highness, note[140]
    This dangerous conception in this point.[141][142]
    Not friended by his wish, to your high person[142]               140
    His will is most malignant, and it stretches
    Beyond you to your friends.

    _Q. Kath._                  My learn'd lord cardinal,
    Deliver all with charity.

    _King._                   Speak on:
    How grounded he his title to the crown
    Upon our fail? to this point hast thou heard him                 145
    At any time speak aught?

    _Surv._                  He was brought to this[143]
    By a vain prophecy of Nicholas Henton.[144]

    _King._ What was that Henton?[145]

    _Surv._                       Sir, a Chartreux friar,
    His confessor, who fed him every minute
    With words of sovereignty.

    _King._                    How know'st thou this?                150

    _Surv._ Not long before your highness sped to France,
    The duke being at the Rose, within the parish
    Saint Lawrence Poultney, did of me demand
    What was the speech among the Londoners
    Concerning the French journey: I replied,                        155
    Men fear'd the French would prove perfidious,[146]
    To the king's danger. Presently the duke
    Said, 'twas the fear indeed, and that he doubted
    'Twould prove the verity of certain words
    Spoke by a holy monk; 'that oft,' says he,                       160
    'Hath sent to me, wishing me to permit
    John de la Car, my chaplain, a choice hour[147]
    To hear from him a matter of some moment:
    Whom after under the confession's seal[148][149]
    He solemnly had sworn that what he spoke[148]                    165
    My chaplain to no creature living but[148]
    To me should utter, with demure confidence[148][150]
    This pausingly ensued: Neither the king nor's heirs,[151]
    Tell you the duke, shall prosper: bid him strive
    To gain the love o' the commonalty: the duke[152]                170
    Shall govern England.'[153]

    _Q. Kath._             If I know you well,
    You were the duke's surveyor and lost your office
    On the complaint o' the tenants: take good heed
    You charge not in your spleen a noble person
    And spoil your nobler soul: I say, take heed;[154]               175
    Yes, heartily beseech you.[155]

    _King._                    Let him on.[156]
    Go forward.[156]

    _Surv._      On my soul, I'll speak but truth.
    I told my lord the duke, by the devil's illusions
    The monk might be deceived; and that 'twas dangerous for him[157]
    To ruminate on this so far, until[157]                           180
    It forged him some design, which, being believed,
    It was much like to do: he answer'd 'Tush,
    It can do me no damage;' adding further,
    That, had the king in his last sickness fail'd,
    The cardinal's and Sir Thomas Lovell's heads                     185
    Should have gone off.

    _King._               Ha! what, so rank? Ah, ha!
    There's mischief in this man: canst thou say further?

    _Surv._ I can, my liege.

    _King._                  Proceed.

    _Surv._                           Being at Greenwich,
    After your highness had reproved the duke
    About Sir William Blomer--[158]

    _King._                    I remember[159]                       190
    Of such a time: being my sworn servant,[159][160]
    The duke retain'd him his. But on; what hence?

    _Surv._ 'If' quoth he 'I for this had been committed,
    As to the Tower I thought, I would have play'd[161]
    The part my father meant to act upon                             195
    The usurper Richard; who, being at Salisbury,
    Made suit to come in's presence; which if granted,[162]
    As he made semblance of his duty, would[163]
    Have put his knife into him.'

    _King._                       A giant traitor!

    _Wol._ Now, madam, may his highness live in freedom,             200
    And this man out of prison?[164]

    _Q. Kath._                  God mend all!

    _King._ There's something more would out of thee; what say'st?

    _Surv._ After 'the duke his father,' with the 'knife,'[165]
    He stretch'd him, and with one hand on his dagger,
    Another spread on's breast, mounting his eyes,                   205
    He did discharge a horrible oath, whose tenour
    Was, were he evil used, he would outgo
    His father by as much as a performance
    Does an irresolute purpose.

    _King._                     There's his period,                  210
    To sheathe his knife in us. He is attach'd;
    Call him to present trial: if he may
    Find mercy in the law, 'tis his; if none,
    Let him not seek't of us: by day and night![166]
    He's traitor to the height.                          [_Exeunt._[167]


SCENE III. _An antechamber in the palace._

          _Enter the_ LORD CHAMBERLAIN _and_ LORD SANDS.[168]

    _Cham._ Is't possible the spells of France should juggle[169]
    Men into such strange mysteries?[170]

    _Sands._                         New customs,
    Though they be never so ridiculous,
    Nay, let 'em be unmanly, yet are follow'd.[171]

    _Cham._ As far as I see, all the good our English                  5
    Have got by the late voyage is but merely[172]
    A fit or two o' the face; but they are shrewd ones;
    For when they hold 'em, you would swear directly
    Their very noses had been counsellors
    To Pepin or Clotharius, they keep state so.                       10

    _Sands._ They have all new legs, and lame ones: one would take it,[173]
    That never saw 'em pace before, the spavin[174]
    Or springhalt reign'd among 'em.[175]

    _Cham._                          Death! my lord,
    Their clothes are after such a pagan cut too,[176]
    That, sure, they've worn out Christendom.

                    _Enter_ SIR THOMAS LOVELL.[177]

                                              How now!                15
    What news, Sir Thomas Lovell?

    _Lov._                        Faith, my lord,
    I hear of none but the new proclamation
    That's clapp'd upon the court-gate.

    _Cham._                             What is't for?

    _Lov._ The reformation of our travell'd gallants,
    That fill the court with quarrels, talk, and tailors.             20

    _Cham._ I'm glad 'tis there: now I would pray our monsieurs[178]
    To think an English courtier may be wise,
    And never see the Louvre.[179]

    _Lov._                    They must either,
    For so run the conditions, leave those remnants
    Of fool and feather that they got in France,                      25
    With all their honourable points of ignorance
    Pertaining thereunto, as fights and fireworks,[180]
    Abusing better men than they can be
    Out of a foreign wisdom, renouncing clean[181]
    The faith they have in tennis and tall stockings,                 30
    Short blister'd breeches and those types of travel,[182]
    And understand again like honest men,
    Or pack to their old playfellows: there, I take it,
    They may, 'cum privilegio,' wear away[183]
    The lag end of their lewdness, and be laugh'd at.                 35

    _Sands._ 'Tis time to give 'em physic, their diseases[184]
    Are grown so catching.

    _Cham._                What a loss our ladies
    Will have of these trim vanities!

    _Lov._                            Ay, marry,
    There will be woe indeed, lords: the sly whoresons
    Have got a speeding trick to lay down ladies;                     40
    A French song and a fiddle has no fellow.

    _Sands._ The devil fiddle 'em! I am glad they are going,[185]
    For, sure, there's no converting of 'em: now[186]
    An honest country lord, as I am, beaten
    A long time out of play, may bring his plain-song,                45
    And have an hour of hearing; and, by'r lady,
    Held current music too.[187]

    _Cham._                 Well said, Lord Sands;
    Your colt's tooth is not cast yet.[188]

    _Sands._                           No, my lord;
    Nor shall not, while I have a stump.[189]

    _Cham._                              Sir Thomas,
    Whither were you a-going?[190]

    _Lov._                    To the cardinal's:                      50
    Your lordship is a guest too.

    _Cham._                       O, 'tis true:
    This night he makes a supper, and a great one,
    To many lords and ladies; there will be
    The beauty of this kingdom, I'll assure you.

    _Lov._ That churchman bears a bounteous mind indeed,[191]         55
    A hand as fruitful as the land that feeds us;
    His dews fall every where.[192]

    _Cham._                    No doubt he's noble;
    He had a black mouth that said other of him.

    _Sands._ He may, my lord; has wherewithal: in him[193]
    Sparing would show a worse sin than ill doctrine:                 60
    Men of his way should be most liberal;[194]
    They are set here for examples.[195]

    _Cham._                         True, they are so;
    But few now give so great ones. My barge stays;[196]
    Your lordship shall along. Come, good Sir Thomas,
    We shall be late else; which I would not be,                      65
    For I was spoke to, with Sir Henry Guildford
    This night to be comptrollers.

    _Sands._                       I am your lordship's.      [_Exeunt._


SCENE IV. _A Hall in York Place._

    _Hautboys. A small table under a state for the_ CARDINAL, _a
        longer table for the guests. Then enter_ ANNE BULLEN _and
        divers other_ Ladies _and_ Gentlemen _as guests, at one
        door; at another door, enter_ SIR HENRY GUILDFORD.[197]

    _Guild._ Ladies, a general welcome from his grace[198]
    Salutes ye all; this night he dedicates
    To fair content and you: none here, he hopes,
    In all this noble bevy, has brought with her
    One care abroad; he would have all as merry[199]                   5
    As, first, good company, good wine, good welcome,[200]
    Can make good people.

  _Enter_ LORD CHAMBERLAIN, LORD SANDS, _and_ SIR THOMAS LOVELL.[201]

                          O, my lord, you're tardy:
    The very thought of this fair company
    Clapp'd wings to me.

    _Cham._              You are young, Sir Harry Guildford.[202]

    _Sands._ Sir Thomas Lovell, had the cardinal                      10
    But half my lay thoughts in him, some of these
    Should find a running banquet ere they rested,
    I think would better please 'em: by my life,
    They are a sweet society of fair ones.

    _Lov._ O, that your lordship were but now confessor               15
    To one or two of these!

    _Sands._                I would I were;
    They should find easy penance.

    _Lov._                         Faith, how easy?

    _Sands._ As easy as a down-bed would afford it.

    _Cham._ Sweet ladies, will it please you sit? Sir Harry,
    Place you that side; I'll take the charge of this:                20
    His grace is entering. Nay, you must not freeze;
    Two women placed together makes cold weather:[203]
    My Lord Sands, you are one will keep 'em waking;
    Pray, sit between these ladies.

    _Sands._                        By my faith,
    And thank your lordship. By your leave, sweet ladies:[204]        25
    If I chance to talk a little wild, forgive me;
    I had it from my father.

    _Anne._                  Was he mad, sir?

    _Sands._ O, very mad, exceeding mad, in love too:
    But he would bite none; just as I do now,
    He would kiss you twenty with a breath.          [_Kisses her._[205]

    _Cham._                                 Well said, my lord.       30
    So, now you're fairly seated. Gentlemen,[206]
    The penance lies on you, if these fair ladies
    Pass away frowning.

    _Sands._            For my little cure,[207]
    Let me alone.

       _Hautboys. Enter_ CARDINAL WOLSEY, _and takes his state_.

    _Wol._ You're welcome, my fair guests: that noble lady[208]       35
    Or gentleman that is not freely merry,
    Is not my friend: this, to confirm my welcome;[209]
    And to you all, good health.                         [_Drinks._[210]

    _Sands._                     Your grace is noble:
    Let me have such a bowl may hold my thanks,
    And save me so much talking.

    _Wol._                       My Lord Sands,                       40
    I am beholding to you: cheer your neighbours.[211]
    Ladies, you are not merry: gentlemen,
    Whose fault is this?

    _Sands._             The red wine first must rise
    In their fair cheeks, my lord; then we shall have 'em
    Talk us to silence.

    _Anne._             You are a merry gamester,[212]                45
    My Lord Sands.[212][213]

    _Sands._ Yes, if I make my play.
    Here's to your ladyship: and pledge it, madam,
    For 'tis to such a thing--[214]

    _Anne._                    You cannot show me.

    _Sands._ I told your grace they would talk anon.

                          [_Drum and trumpet: chambers discharged._[215]

    _Wol._                                           What's that?

    _Cham._ Look out there, some of ye.            [_Exit Servant._[216]

    _Wol._                              What warlike voice,           50
    And to what end, is this? Nay, ladies, fear not;
    By all the laws of war you're privileged.[208]

                        _Re-enter_ Servant.[217]

    _Cham._ How now! what is't?

    _Serv._                     A noble troop of strangers;
    For so they seem: they've left their barge, and landed;[218]
    And hither make, as great ambassadors                             55
    From foreign princes.

    _Wol._                Good lord chamberlain,
    Go, give 'em welcome; you can speak the French tongue;[219][220]
    And, pray, receive 'em nobly and conduct 'em[219]
    Into our presence, where this heaven of beauty
    Shall shine at full upon them. Some attend him.                   60

       [_Exit Chamberlain, attended. All rise, and tables removed._[221]

    A noble company! what are their pleasures?

    _Cham._ Because they speak no English, thus they pray'd[225]      65
    To tell your grace, that, having heard by fame
    Of this so noble and so fair assembly
    This night to meet here, they could do no less,
    Out of the great respect they bear to beauty,
    But leave their flocks, and under your fair conduct               70
    Crave leave to view these ladies and entreat
    An hour of revels with 'em.[226]

    _Wol._                      Say, lord chamberlain,[226]
    They have done my poor house grace; for which I pay 'em[226][227][228]
    A thousand thanks and pray 'em take their pleasures.[226][227]

                      [_They choose. The King chooses Anne Bullen._[229]

    Till now I never knew thee!                         [_Music. Dance._

    There should be one amongst 'em, by his person,[231]
    More worthy this place than myself; to whom,
    If I but knew him, with my love and duty                          80
    I would surrender it.

    _Cham._               I will, my lord.

                                         [_Whispers the Masquers._[233]

    _Wol._ What say they?

    _Cham._               Such a one, they all confess,
    There is indeed; which they would have your grace
    Find out, and he will take it.

    _Wol._                         Let me see then.[234]
    By all your good leaves, gentlemen; here I'll make                85
    My royal choice.

    _King._          [_Unmasking_] Ye have found him, cardinal:[235]
    You hold a fair assembly; you do well, lord:
    You are a churchman, or, I'll tell you, cardinal,
    I should judge now unhappily.[236]

    _Wol._                        I am glad
    Your grace is grown so pleasant.

    _King._                          My lord chamberlain,             90
    Prithee, come hither: what fair lady's that?

    _Cham._ An't please your grace, Sir Thomas Bullen's daughter,[237]
    The Viscount Rochford, one of her highness' women.[237][238]

    _King._ By heaven, she is a dainty one. Sweetheart,[239]
    I were unmannerly, to take you out,                               95
    And not to kiss you. A health, gentlemen!
    Let it go round.

    _Wol._ Sir Thomas Lovell, is the banquet ready
    I' the privy chamber?

    _Lov._                Yes, my lord.

    _Wol._                              Your grace,
    I fear, with dancing is a little heated.                         100

    _King._ I fear, too much.

    _Wol._                    There's fresher air, my lord,
    In the next chamber.

    _King._ Lead in your ladies, every one. Sweet partner,
    I must not yet forsake you. Let's be merry,[240]
    Good my lord cardinal: I have half a dozen healths[240][241]     105
    To drink to these fair ladies, and a measure
    To lead 'em once again; and then let's dream
    Who's best in favour. Let the music knock it.[242]

                                                [_Exeunt with trumpets._

ACT II.


SCENE I. _Westminster. A street._

                 _Enter two_ Gentlemen, _meeting_.[243]

    _First Gent._ Whither away so fast?

    _Sec. Gent._                        O, God save ye![244]
    Even to the hall, to hear what shall become[245]
    Of the great Duke of Buckingham.

    _First Gent._                    I'll save you
    That labour, sir. All's now done, but the ceremony
    Of bringing back the prisoner.

    _Sec. Gent._                   Were you there?                     5

    _First Gent._ Yes, indeed was I.

    _Sec. Gent._                     Pray, speak what has happen'd.[246]

    _First Gent._ You may guess quickly what.

    _Sec. Gent._                    Is he found guilty?

    _First Gent._ Yes, truly is he, and condemn'd upon 't.[247]

    _Sec. Gent._ I am sorry for 't.[248]

    _First Gent._                   So are a number more.

    _Sec. Gent._ But, pray, how pass'd it?                            10

    _First Gent._ I'll tell you in a little. The great duke
    Came to the bar; where to his accusations
    He pleaded still not guilty and alleged[249]
    Many sharp reasons to defeat the law.
    The king's attorney on the contrary                               15
    Urged on the examinations, proofs, confessions[250]
    Of divers witnesses; which the duke desired
    To have brought viva voce to his face:[251]
    At which appear'd against him his surveyor;
    Sir Gilbert Peck his chancellor; and John Car,                    20
    Confessor to him; with that devil monk,
    Hopkins, that made this mischief.

    _Sec. Gent._                      That was he
    That fed him with his prophecies?[252]

    _First Gent._                     The same.
    All these accused him strongly; which he fain
    Would have flung from him, but indeed he could not:               25
    And so his peers upon this evidence
    Have found him guilty of high treason. Much
    He spoke, and learnedly, for life, but all
    Was either pitied in him or forgotten.

    _Sec. Gent._ After all this, how did he bear himself?             30

    _First Gent._ When he was brought again to the bar, to hear
    His knell rung out, his judgement, he was stirr'd
    With such an agony, he sweat extremely[253]
    And something spoke in choler, ill and hasty:
    But he fell to himself again and sweetly                          35
    In all the rest show'd a most noble patience.

    _Sec. Gent._ I do not think he fears death.

    _First Gent._                        Sure, he does not;
    He never was so womanish; the cause
    He may a little grieve at.

    _Sec. Gent._               Certainly
    The cardinal is the end of this.[254]

    _First Gent._                    'Tis likely,                     40
    By all conjectures: first, Kildare's attainder,[255]
    Then deputy of Ireland; who removed,
    Earl Surrey was sent thither, and in haste too,
    Lest he should help his father.

    _Sec. Gent._                    That trick of state
    Was a deep envious one.[256]

    _First Gent._           At his return                             45
    No doubt he will requite it. This is noted,
    And generally, whoever the king favours,
    The cardinal instantly will find employment,[257]
    And far enough from court too.

    _Sec. Gent._                   All the commons
    Hate him perniciously, and, o' my conscience,                     50
    Wish him ten fathom deep: this duke as much
    They love and dote on; call him bounteous Buckingham,
    The mirror of all courtesy--[258]

    _First Gent._                Stay there, sir,
    And see the noble ruin'd man you speak of.

    _Enter_ BUCKINGHAM _from his arraignment, tipstaves before him,
        the axe with the edge towards him, halberds on each side,
        accompanied with_ SIR THOMAS LOVELL, SIR NICHOLAS VAUX, SIR
        WALTER SANDS, _and common people, &c._[259]

    _Sec. Gent._ Let's stand close, and behold him.

    _Buck._                                    All good people,[260]  55
    You that thus far have come to pity me,[261]
    Hear what I say, and then go home and lose me.
    I have this day received a traitor's judgement,
    And by that name must die: yet, heaven bear witness,
    And if I have a conscience, let it sink me,                       60
    Even as the axe falls, if I be not faithful!
    The law I bear no malice for my death;[262]
    'T has done upon the premisses but justice:[263]
    But those that sought it I could wish more Christians:
    Be what they will, I heartily forgive 'em:[264]                   65
    Yet let 'em look they glory not in mischief,[264]
    Nor build their evils on the graves of great men;[265]
    For then my guiltless blood must cry against 'em.
    For further life in this world I ne'er hope,
    Nor will I sue, although the king have mercies[266]               70
    More than I dare make faults. You few that loved me[267]
    And dare be bold to weep for Buckingham,
    His noble friends and fellows, whom to leave
    Is only bitter to him, only dying,
    Go with me, like good angels, to my end,                          75
    And, as the long divorce of steel falls on me,
    Make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice
    And lift my soul to heaven. Lead on, o' God's name.[268]

    _Lov._ I do beseech your grace, for charity,
    If ever any malice in your heart                                  80
    Were hid against me, now to forgive me frankly.[269]

    _Buck._ Sir Thomas Lovell, I as free forgive you
    As I would be forgiven: I forgive all;
    There cannot be those numberless offences
    'Gainst me, that I cannot take peace with: no black
        envy[270][271][272][273]  85
    Shall make my grave. Commend me to his grace,[270][272]
    And if he speak of Buckingham, pray tell him
    You met him half in heaven: my vows and prayers
    Yet are the king's, and, till my soul forsake,[274]
    Shall cry for blessings on him: may he live                       90
    Longer than I have time to tell his years!
    Ever beloved and loving may his rule be![275]
    And when old time shall lead him to his end,
    Goodness and he fill up one monument!

    _Lov._ To the water side I must conduct your grace;               95
    Then give my charge up to Sir Nicholas Vaux,
    Who undertakes you to your end.

    _Vaux._                         Prepare there;
    The duke is coming: see the barge be ready,
    And fit it with such furniture as suits
    The greatness of his person.

    _Buck._                      Nay, Sir Nicholas,                  100
    Let it alone; my state now will but mock me.[276]
    When I came hither, I was lord high constable
    And Duke of Buckingham; now, poor Edward Bohun:[277]
    Yet I am richer than my base accusers,
    That never knew what truth meant: I now seal it;                 105
    And with that blood will make 'em one day groan for't.
    My noble father, Henry of Buckingham,
    Who first raised head against usurping Richard,
    Flying for succour to his servant Banister,
    Being distress'd, was by that wretch betray'd,                   110
    And without trial fell; God's peace be with him!
    Henry the Seventh succeeding, truly pitying
    My father's loss, like a most royal prince,
    Restored me to my honours, and out of ruins
    Made my name once more noble. Now his son,                       115
    Henry the Eighth, life, honour, name and all[278]
    That made me happy, at one stroke has taken
    For ever from the world. I had my trial,
    And must needs say, a noble one; which makes me
    A little happier than my wretched father:                        120
    Yet thus far we are one in fortunes: both[279]
    Fell by our servants, by those men we loved most;[280]
    A most unnatural and faithless service!
    Heaven has an end in all: yet, you that hear me,
    This from a dying man receive as certain:                        125
    Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels
    Be sure you be not loose; for those you make friends[281]
    And give your hearts to, when they once perceive
    The least rub in your fortunes, fall away
    Like water from ye, never found again                            130
    But where they mean to sink ye. All good people,[282]
    Pray for me! I must now forsake ye: the last hour[283]
    Of my long weary life is come upon me.[284]
    Farewell:[285]
    And when you would say something that is sad,[284][286]          135
    Speak how I fell. I have done; and God forgive me![287]

                                               [_Exeunt Duke and Train._

    _First Gent._ O, this is full of pity! Sir, it calls,
    I fear, too many curses on their heads
    That were the authors.

    _Sec. Gent._           If the duke be guiltless,
    'Tis full of woe: yet I can give you inkling                     140
    Of an ensuing evil, if it fall,
    Greater than this.

    _First Gent._      Good angels keep it from us!
    What may it be? You do not doubt my faith, sir?[288]

    _Sec. Gent._ This secret is so weighty, 'twill require
    A strong faith to conceal it.

    _First Gent._                 Let me have it;                    145
    I do not talk much.

    _Sec. Gent._        I am confident;
    You shall, sir: did you not of late days hear
    A buzzing of a separation
    Between the king and Katharine?

    _First Gent._                   Yes, but it held not:[289]
    For when the king once heard it, out of anger                    150
    He sent command to the lord mayor straight[290]
    To stop the rumour and allay those tongues
    That durst disperse it.

    _See. Gent._            But that slander, sir,
    Is found a truth now: for it grows again[291]
    Fresher than e'er it was, and held for certain                   155
    The king will venture at it. Either the cardinal,
    Or some about him near, have, out of malice
    To the good queen, possess'd him with a scruple
    That will undo her: to confirm this too,
    Cardinal Campeius is arrived, and lately;                        160
    As all think, for this business.

    _First Gent._                    'Tis the cardinal;
    And merely to revenge him on the emperor,
    For not bestowing on him at his asking
    The archbishopric of Toledo, this is purposed.

    _Sec. Gent._ I think you have hit the mark: but is't not
                    cruel[292]  165
    That she should feel the smart of this? The cardinal
    Will have his will, and she must fall.

    _First Gent._                          'Tis woeful.
    We are too open here to argue this;
    Let's think in private more.                         [_Exeunt._[293]


SCENE II. _An ante-chamber in the palace._

         _Enter the_ LORD CHAMBERLAIN, _reading a letter_.[294]

    _Cham._ 'My lord, the horses your lordship sent for, with all the[295]
    care I had, I saw well chosen, ridden, and furnished. They were[295]
    young and handsome, and of the best breed in the north. When they[295]
    were ready to set out for London, a man of my lord cardinal's, by[295]
    commission and main power, took 'em from me; with this reason:
        His[295][296]  5
    master would be served before a subject, if not before the king; which[295]
    stopped our mouths, sir.'[295][297]
    I fear he will indeed: well, let him have them:[298]
    He will have all, I think.[298]

     _Enter to the_ LORD CHAMBERLAIN, _the_ DUKES OF NORFOLK _and_
                                SUFFOLK.

    _Nor._ Well met, my lord chamberlain.[299]                        10

    _Cham._ Good day to both your graces.

    _Suf._ How is the king employ'd?

    _Cham._                          I left him private,
    Full of sad thoughts and troubles.

    _Nor._                             What's the cause?

    _Cham._ It seems the marriage with his brother's wife
    Has crept too near his conscience.

    _Suf._                             No, his conscience             15
    Has crept too near another lady.

    _Nor._                           'Tis so:
    This is the cardinal's doing, the king-cardinal:[300]
    That blind priest, like the eldest son of fortune,
    Turns what he list. The king will know him one day.[301]

    _Suf._ Pray God he do! he'll never know himself else.[302]        20

    _Nor._ How holily he works in all his business![303]
    And with what zeal! for, now he has crack'd the league
    Between us and the emperor, the queen's great nephew.[304]
    He dives into the king's soul, and there scatters
    Dangers, doubts, wringing of the conscience,[305]                 25
    Fears and despairs; and all these for his marriage:[306]
    And out of all these to restore the king,
    He counsels a divorce; a loss of her
    That, like a jewel, has hung twenty years
    About his neck, yet never lost her lustre,                        30
    Of her that loves him with that excellence
    That angels love good men with, even of her
    That, when the greatest stroke of fortune falls,
    Will bless the king: and is not this course pious?

    _Cham._ Heaven keep me from such counsel! 'Tis most true          35
    These news are every where; every tongue speaks 'em,
    And every true heart weeps for't: all that dare
    Look into these affairs see this main end,[307]
    The French king's sister. Heaven will one day open
    The king's eyes that so long have slept upon                      40
    This bold bad man.

    _Suf._             And free us from his slavery.

    _Nor._ We had need pray,
    And heartily, for our deliverance;[308]
    Or this imperious man will work us all
    From princes into pages: all men's honours                        45
    Lie like one lump before him, to be fashion'd[309]
    Into what pitch he please.[310]

    _Suf._                     For me, my lords,
    I love him not, nor fear him; there's my creed:
    As I am made without him, so I'll stand,
    If the king please; his curses and his blessings                  50
    Touch me alike; they're breath I not believe in.[311]
    I knew him, and I know him; so I leave him
    To him that made him proud, the pope.

    _Nor._                                Let's in;
    And with some other business put the king
    From these sad thoughts that work too much upon him:              55
    My lord, you'll bear us company?

    _Cham._                          Excuse me;
    The king has sent me otherwhere: besides,
    You'll find a most unfit time to disturb him:[312]
    Health to your lordships.

    _Nor._                    Thanks, my good lord chamberlain.

                                  [_Exit Lord Chamberlain; and the King
                                     draws the curtain and sits reading
                                                       pensively._[313]

    _Suf._ How sad he looks! sure, he is much afflicted.[314]         60

    _King._ Who's there, ha?

    _Nor._                   Pray God he be not angry.[315]

    _King._ Who's there, I say? How dare you thrust yourselves
    Into my private meditations?
    Who am I? ha?

    _Nor._ A gracious king that pardons all offences                  65
    Malice ne'er meant: our breach of duty this way
    Is business of estate, in which we come
    To know your royal pleasure.

    _King._                      Ye are too bold:[316]
    Go to; I'll make ye know your times of business:
    Is this an hour for temporal affairs, ha?                         70

        _Enter_ WOLSEY _and_ CAMPEIUS, _with a commission_.[317]

    Who's there? my good lord cardinal? O my Wolsey,
    The quiet of my wounded conscience,
    Thou art a cure fit for a king. [_To Camp._] You're welcome,[318]
    Most learned reverend sir, into our kingdom:
    Use us and it. [_To Wols._] My good lord, have great care[319]    75
    I be not found a talker.

    _Wol._                   Sir, you cannot.
    I would your grace would give us but an hour
    Of private conference.

    _King._                [_To Nor. and Suf._] We are busy; go.

    _Nor._ [_Aside to Suf._] This priest has no pride in him?[320]

    _Suf._ [_Aside to Nor._] Not to speak of:[321][322]
    I would not be so sick though for his place:[321]                 80
    But this cannot continue.[321][323]

    _Nor._ [_Aside to Suf._] If it do,[321][323]
    I'll venture one have-at-him.[324]

    _Suf._ [_Aside to Nor._] I another.

                                          [_Exeunt Norfolk and Suffolk._

    _Wol._ Your grace has given a precedent of wisdom[325]
    Above all princes, in committing freely
    Your scruple to the voice of Christendom:                         85
    Who can be angry now? what envy reach you?
    The Spaniard, tied by blood and favour to her,
    Must now confess, if they have any goodness,
    The trial just and noble. All the clerks,
    I mean the learned ones, in Christian kingdoms[326]               90
    Have their free voices: Rome, the nurse of judgement,[327]
    Invited by your noble self, hath sent
    One general tongue unto us, this good man,
    This just and learned priest, Cardinal Campeius;[328]
    Whom once more I present unto your highness.                      95

    _King._ And once more in mine arms I bid him welcome,
    And thank the holy conclave for their loves:
    They have sent me such a man I would have wish'd for.[329]

    _Cam._ Your grace must needs deserve all strangers' loves,
    You are so noble. To your highness' hand                         100
    I tender my commission; by whose virtue,
    The court of Rome commanding, you, my lord[330]
    Cardinal of York, are join'd with me their servant
    In the impartial judging of this business.

    _King._ Two equal men. The queen shall be acquainted             105
    Forthwith for what you come. Where's Gardiner?

    _Wol._ I know your majesty has always loved her
    So dear in heart, not to deny her that[331]
    A woman of less place might ask by law,
    Scholars allow'd freely to argue for her.                        110

    _King._ Ay, and the best she shall have; and my favour
    To him that does best: God forbid else. Cardinal,
    Prithee, call Gardiner to me, my new secretary:
    I find him a fit fellow.                             [_Exit_ Wolsey.

                _Re-enter_ WOLSEY, _with_ GARDINER.[332]

    _Wol._ [_Aside to Gard._] Give me your hand: much joy
              and favour to you;[333]  115
    You are the king's now.

    _Gard._ [_Aside to Wol._] But to be commanded[333]
    For ever by your grace, whose hand has raised me.

    _King._ Come hither, Gardiner.           [_Walks and whispers._[334]

    _Cam._ My Lord of York, was not one Doctor Pace
    In this man's place before him?

    _Wol._                          Yes, he was.                     120

    _Cam._ Was he not held a learned man?

    _Wol._                                 Yes, surely.

    _Cam._ Believe me, there's an ill opinion spread then,
    Even of yourself, lord cardinal.

    _Wol._                           How! of me?

    _Cam._ They will not stick to say you envied him,
    And fearing he would rise, he was so virtuous,                   125
    Kept him a foreign man still; which so grieved him
    That he ran mad and died.

    _Wol._                    Heaven's peace be with him!
    That's Christian care enough: for living murmurers
    There's places of rebuke. He was a fool;
    For he would needs be virtuous: that good fellow,                130
    If I command him, follows my appointment:
    I will have none so near else. Learn this, brother,
    We live not to be grip'd by meaner persons.

    _King._ Deliver this with modesty to the queen.

                                                       [_Exit Gardiner._

    The most convenient place that I can think of                    135
    For such receipt of learning is Black-Friars;
    There ye shall meet about this weighty business.
    My Wolsey, see it furnish'd. O, my lord,
    Would it not grieve an able man to leave
    So sweet a bedfellow? But, conscience, conscience!               140
    O, 'tis a tender place; and I must leave her.             [_Exeunt._


SCENE III. _An ante-chamber of the Queen's apartments._[335]

                 _Enter_ ANNE BULLEN _and an old_ Lady.

    _Anne._ Not for that neither: here's the pang that pinches:
    His highness having lived so long with her, and she[336]
    So good a lady that no tongue could ever
    Pronounce dishonour of her--by my life,
    She never knew harm-doing--O, now, after                           5
    So many courses of the sun enthroned,
    Still growing in a majesty and pomp, the which[337][338]
    To leave a thousand-fold more bitter than[337]
    'Tis sweet at first to acquire--after this process,[337]
    To give her the avaunt! it is a pity                              10
    Would move a monster.

    _Old L._              Hearts of most hard temper
    Melt and lament for her.

    _Anne._                  O, God's will! much better[339]
    She ne'er had known pomp: though 't be temporal,
    Yet, if that quarrel, fortune, do divorce[340]
    It from the bearer, 'tis a sufferance panging                     15
    As soul and body's severing.

    _Old L._                     Alas, poor lady![341]
    She's a stranger now again.[342]

    _Anne._                     So much the more
    Must pity drop upon her. Verily,
    I swear, 'tis better to be lowly born
    And range with humble livers in content                           20
    Than to be perk'd up in a glistering grief
    And wear a golden sorrow.

    _Old L._                  Our content
    Is our best having.

    _Anne._             By my troth and maidenhead,
    I would not be a queen.

    _Old L._                Beshrew me, I would,
    And venture maidenhead for't; and so would you,                   25
    For all this spice of your hypocrisy:
    You, that have so fair parts of woman on you,
    Have too a woman's heart; which ever yet
    Affected eminence, wealth, sovereignty;
    Which, to say sooth, are blessings; and which gifts--             30
    Saving your mincing--the capacity
    Of your soft cheveril conscience would receive,[343]
    If you might please to stretch it.

    _Anne._                            Nay, good troth.[344]

    _Old L._ Yes, troth, and troth; you would not be a queen?

    _Anne._ No, not for all the riches under heaven.                  35

    _Old L._ 'Tis strange: a three-pence bow'd would hire me,[345]
    Old as I am, to queen it: but, I pray you,
    What think you of a duchess? have you limbs
    To bear that load of title?

    _Anne._                     No, in truth.

    _Old L._ Then you are weakly made: pluck off a little;[346]       40
    I would not be a young count in your way,
    For more than blushing comes to: if your back
    Cannot vouchsafe this burthen, 'tis too weak
    Ever to get a boy.

    _Anne._            How you do talk![347]
    I swear again, I would not be a queen                             45
    For all the world.

    _Old L._           In faith, for little England
    You'ld venture an emballing: I myself[348]
    Would for Carnarvonshire, although there 'long'd[349]
    No more to the crown but that. Lo, who comes here?

                     _Enter the_ LORD CHAMBERLAIN.

    _Cham._ Good morrow, ladies. What were't worth to know            50
    The secret of your conference?

    _Anne._                        My good lord,
    Not your demand; it values not your asking:
    Our mistress' sorrows we were pitying.

    _Cham._ It was a gentle business, and becoming
    The action of good women: there is hope                           55
    All will be well.

    _Anne._ Now, I pray God, amen!

    _Cham._ You bear a gentle mind, and heavenly blessings
    Follow such creatures. That you may, fair lady,
    Perceive I speak sincerely, and high note's[350]
    Ta'en of your many virtues, the king's majesty                    60
    Commends his good opinion of you, and[351]
    Does purpose honour to you no less flowing
    Than Marchioness of Pembroke; to which title
    A thousand pound a year, annual support,[352]
    Out of his grace he adds.

    _Anne._                   I do not know                           65
    What kind of my obedience I should tender;[353]
    More than my all is nothing: nor my prayers[354]
    Are not words duly hallow'd, nor my wishes
    More worth than empty vanities; yet prayers and wishes[355]
    Are all I can return. Beseech your lordship,                      70
    Vouchsafe to speak my thanks and my obedience,
    As from a blushing handmaid, to his highness,
    Whose health and royalty I pray for.

    _Cham._                              Lady,
    I shall not fail to approve the fair conceit[356]
    The king hath of you. [_Aside_] I have perused her well;[357]     75
    Beauty and honour in her are so mingled[357]
    That they have caught the king: and who knows yet[357]
    But from this lady may proceed a gem[357]
    To lighten all this isle?--I'll to the king,[357]
    And say I spoke with you.[357]

    _Anne._                   My honour'd lord.                       80

                                          [_Exit Lord Chamberlain._[358]

    _Old L._ Why, this it is; see, see!
    I have been begging sixteen years in court,
    Am yet a courtier beggarly, nor could[359]
    Come pat betwixt too early and too late
    For any suit of pounds; and you, O fate!                          85
    A very fresh fish here--fie, fie, fie upon[360]
    This compell'd fortune!--have your mouth fill'd up
    Before you open it.

    _Anne._             This is strange to me.

    _Old L._ How tastes it? is it bitter? forty pence, no.[361]
    There was a lady once, 'tis an old story,[362]                    90
    That would not be a queen, that would she not,
    For all the mud in Egypt: have you heard it?

    _Anne._ Come, you are pleasant.

    _Old L._                        With your theme, I could
    O'ermount the lark. The Marchioness of Pembroke!
    A thousand pounds a year for pure respect!                        95
    No other obligation! By my life,[363]
    That promises moe thousands: honour's train[364]
    Is longer than his foreskirt. By this time
    I know your back will bear a duchess: say,
    Are you not stronger than you were?

    _Anne._                             Good lady,                   100
    Make yourself mirth with your particular fancy,
    And leave me out on't. Would I had no being,
    If this salute my blood a jot: it faints me,[365]
    To think what follows.
    The queen is comfortless, and we forgetful                       105
    In our long absence: pray, do not deliver
    What here you've heard to her.

    _Old L._                       What do you think me?[366]

                                                              [_Exeunt._


SCENE IV. _A hall in Black-Friars._

    _Trumpets, sennet and cornets. Enter two_ Vergers, _with short
        silver wands; next them, two_ Scribes, _in the habit of
        doctors; after them, the_ ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY _alone;
        after him, the_ BISHOPS OF LINCOLN, ELY, ROCHESTER, _and_
        Saint ASAPH; _next them, with some small distance, follows
        a_ Gentleman _bearing the purse, with the great seal, and a
        cardinal's hat; then two_ Priests, _bearing each a silver
        cross; then a_ Gentleman Usher _bare-headed, accompanied
        with a_ Sergeant at arms _bearing a silver mace; then two_
        Gentlemen _bearing two great silver pillars; after them,
        side by side, the two_ CARDINALS; _two_ Noblemen _with the
        sword and mace. The_ KING _takes place under the cloth of
        state; the two_ CARDINALS _sit under him as judges. The_
        QUEEN _takes place some distance from the_ KING. _The_
        BISHOPS _place themselves on each side the court, in manner
        of a consistory; below them, the_ Scribes. _The_ LORDS _sit
        next the_ BISHOPS. _The rest of the_ Attendants _stand in
        convenient order about the stage_.[367]

    _Wol._ Whilst our commission from Rome is read,
    Let silence be commanded.

    _King._                       What's the need?
    It hath already publicly been read,
    And on all sides the authority allow'd;
    You may then spare that time.

    _Wol._                        Be't so. Proceed.                    5

    _Scribe._ Say, Henry King of England, come into the
    court.

    _Crier._ Henry King of England, &c.

    _King._ Here.

    _Scribe._ Say, Katharine Queen of England, come into[368]         10
    the court.[368]

    _Crier._ Katharine Queen of England, &c.

                          [_The Queen makes no answer, rises out of her
                              chair, goes about the court, comes to the
                            King, and kneels at his feet; then speaks._

    _Q. Kath._ Sir, I desire you do me right and justice,[369]
    And to bestow your pity on me; for
    I am a most poor woman and a stranger,                            15
    Born out of your dominions; having here
    No judge indifferent, nor no more assurance[370]
    Of equal friendship and proceeding. Alas, sir,
    In what have I offended you? what cause
    Hath my behaviour given to your displeasure,                      20
    That thus you should proceed to put me off
    And take your good grace from me? Heaven witness,
    I have been to you a true and humble wife,[371]
    At all times to your will conformable,
    Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,                              25
    Yea, subject to your countenance, glad or sorry
    As I saw it inclined: when was the hour[372]
    I ever contradicted your desire,
    Or made it not mine too? Or which of your friends[373]
    Have I not strove to love, although I knew                        30
    He were mine enemy? what friend of mine[374]
    That had to him derived your anger, did I
    Continue in my liking? nay, gave notice[375]
    He was from thence discharged? Sir, call to mind[376]
    That I have been your wife, in this obedience,                    35
    Upward of twenty years, and have been blest
    With many children by you: if in the course
    And process of this time you can report,
    And prove it too, against mine honour aught,
    My bond to wedlock or my love and duty,[377][378]                 40
    Against your sacred person, in God's name,[378]
    Turn me away, and let the foul'st contempt[379]
    Shut door upon me, and so give me up
    To the sharp'st kind of justice. Please you, sir,[380]
    The king, your father, was reputed for                            45
    A prince most prudent, of an excellent[381]
    And unmatch'd wit and judgement: Ferdinand,
    My father, king of Spain, was reckon'd one
    The wisest prince that there had reign'd by many
    A year before: it is not to be question'd                         50
    That they had gather'd a wise council to them
    Of every realm, that did debate this business,
    Who deem'd our marriage lawful: wherefore I humbly[382][383]
    Beseech you, sir, to spare me, till I may[383]
    Be by my friends in Spain advised, whose counsel                  55
    I will implore: if not, i' the name of God,
    Your pleasure be fulfill'd!

    _Wol._                      You have here, lady,
    And of your choice, these reverend fathers; men
    Of singular integrity and learning,
    Yea, the elect o' the land, who are assembled                     60
    To plead your cause: it shall be therefore bootless
    That longer you desire the court, as well[384]
    For your own quiet, as to rectify
    What is unsettled in the king.

    _Cam._                         His grace
    Hath spoken well and justly: therefore, madam,                    65
    It's fit this royal session do proceed,
    And that without delay their arguments
    Be now produced and heard.

    _Q. Kath._                 Lord cardinal,[385]
    To you I speak.[385]

    _Wol._          Your pleasure, madam?

    _Q. Kath._                            Sir,[386][387]
    I am about to weep; but, thinking that[386]                       70
    We are a queen, or long have dream'd so, certain
    The daughter of a king, my drops of tears
    I'll turn to sparks of fire.

    _Wol._                       Be patient yet.[388]

    _Q. Kath._ I will, when you are humble; nay, before,
    Or God will punish me. I do believe,[389]                         75
    Induced by potent circumstances, that
    You are mine enemy, and make my challenge[390]
    You shall not be my judge: for it is you
    Have blown this coal betwixt my lord and me;
    Which God's dew quench! Therefore I say again,                    80
    I utterly abhor, yea, from my soul
    Refuse you for my judge; whom, yet once more,
    I hold my most malicious foe and think not
    At all a friend to truth.

    _Wol._                    I do profess
    You speak not like yourself; who ever yet                         85
    Have stood to charity and display'd the effects
    Of disposition gentle and of wisdom
    O'ertopping woman's power. Madam, you do me wrong:[391]
    I have no spleen against you, nor injustice
    For you or any: how far I have proceeded,[392]                    90
    Or how far further shall, is warranted[393]
    By a commission from the consistory,
    Yea, the whole consistory of Rome. You charge me
    That I have blown this coal: I do deny it:
    The king is present: if it be known to him[394]                   95
    That I gainsay my deed, how may he wound,[395]
    And worthily, my falsehood! yea, as much
    As you have done my truth. If he know[396]
    That I am free of your report, he knows
    I am not of your wrong. Therefore in him                         100
    It lies to cure me; and the cure is to
    Remove these thoughts from you: the which before
    His highness shall speak in, I do beseech
    You, gracious madam, to unthink your speaking
    And to say so no more.[397]

    _Q. Kath._             My lord, my lord,                         105
    I am a simple woman, much too weak
    To oppose your cunning. You're meek and humble-mouth'd;[398]
    You sign your place and calling, in full seeming,
    With meekness and humility; but your heart
    Is cramm'd with arrogancy, spleen, and pride.[399]               110
    You have, by fortune and his highness' favours,[400]
    Gone slightly o'er low steps and now are mounted[401]
    Where powers are your retainers, and your words,[402]
    Domestics to you, serve your will as't please
    Yourself pronounce their office. I must tell you,                115
    You tender more your person's honour than
    Your high profession spiritual; that again
    I do refuse you for my judge, and here,
    Before you all, appeal unto the pope,
    To bring my whole cause 'fore his holiness,                      120
    And to be judged by him.

                     [_She curtsies to the King, and offers to depart._

    _Cam._                   The queen is obstinate,
    Stubborn to justice, apt to accuse it and
    Disdainful to be tried by't: 'tis not well.
    She's going away.

    _King._ Call her again.                                          125

    _Crier._ Katharine Queen of England, come into the court.

    _Gent. Ush._ Madam, you are call'd back.[403]

    _Q. Kath._ What need you note it? pray you, keep your way:
    When you are call'd, return. Now the Lord help![404]
    They vex me past my patience. Pray you, pass on:                 130
    I will not tarry, no, nor ever more
    Upon this business my appearance make
    In any of their courts.    [_Exeunt Queen, and her Attendants._[405]

    _King._                 Go thy ways, Kate:
    That man i' the world who shall report he has
    A better wife, let him in nought be trusted,[406]                135
    For speaking false in that: thou art, alone,
    If thy rare qualities, sweet gentleness,
    Thy meekness saint-like, wife-like government,
    Obeying in commanding, and thy parts
    Sovereign and pious else, could speak thee out,[407]             140
    The queen of earthly queens. She's noble born,
    And like her true nobility she has
    Carried herself towards me.

    _Wol._                      Most gracious sir,
    In humblest manner I require your highness,
    That it shall please you to declare in hearing                   145
    Of all these ears--for where I am robb'd and bound,
    There must I be unloosed, although not there[408]
    At once and fully satisfied--whether ever I[409]
    Did broach this business to your highness, or
    Laid any scruple in your way which might                         150
    Induce you to the question on't? or ever
    Have to you, but with thanks to God for such
    A royal lady, spake one the least word that might[410]
    Be to the prejudice of her present state[411]
    Or touch of her good person?

    _King._                      My lord cardinal,                   155
    I do excuse you; yea, upon mine honour,
    I free you from't. You are not to be taught
    That you have many enemies that know not
    Why they are so, but, like to village-curs,[412]
    Bark when their fellows do: by some of these                     160
    The queen is put in anger. You're excused:[413]
    But will you be more justified? you ever
    Have wish'd the sleeping of this business, never desired[414]
    It to be stirr'd, but oft have hinder'd, oft,[414]
    The passages made toward it: on my honour,[415]                  165
    I speak my good lord cardinal to this point,[416]
    And thus far clear him. Now, what moved me to't,[417]
    I will be bold with time and your attention:
    Then mark the inducement. Thus it came; give heed to't:
    My conscience first received a tenderness,                       170
    Scruple, and prick, on certain speeches utter'd
    By the Bishop of Bayonne, then French ambassador;[418]
    Who had been hither sent on the debating
    A marriage 'twixt the Duke of Orleans and[419]
    Our daughter Mary: i' the progress of this business,             175
    Ere a determinate resolution, he,
    I mean the bishop, did require a respite,[420]
    Wherein he might the king his lord advertise
    Whether our daughter were legitimate,
    Respecting this our marriage with the dowager,                   180
    Sometimes our brother's wife. This respite shook[421]
    The bosom of my conscience, enter'd me,[422]
    Yea, with a splitting power, and made to tremble[423]
    The region of my breast; which forced such way
    That many mazed considerings did throng                          185
    And press'd in with this caution. First, methought
    I stood not in the smile of heaven, who had[424]
    Commanded nature that my lady's womb,
    If it conceived a male-child by me, should
    Do no more offices of life to't than                             190
    The grave does to the dead; for her male issue
    Or died where they were made, or shortly after
    This world had air'd them: hence I took a thought,
    This was a judgement on me, that my kingdom,
    Well worthy the best heir o' the world, should not               195
    Be gladded in't by me: then follows that[425]
    I weigh'd the danger which my realms stood in[426]
    By this my issue's fail; and that gave to me
    Many a groaning throe. Thus hulling in[427]
    The wild sea of my conscience, I did steer                       200
    Toward this remedy whereupon we are[428]
    Now present here together; that's to say,
    I meant to rectify my conscience, which
    I then did feel full sick and yet not well,
    By all the reverend fathers of the land                          205
    And doctors learn'd. First I began in private
    With you, my Lord of Lincoln; you remember
    How under my oppression I did reek,[429]
    When I first moved you.

    _Lin._                  Very well, my liege.

    _King._ I have spoke long: be pleased yourself to say            210
    How far you satisfied me.

    _Lin._                    So please your highness,
    The question did at first so stagger me,
    Bearing a state of mighty moment in't
    And consequence of dread, that I committed
    The daring'st counsel which I had to doubt,                      215
    And did entreat your highness to this course[430]
    Which you are running here.

    _King._                     I then moved you,
    My Lord of Canterbury, and got your leave
    To make this present summons: unsolicited[431]
    I left no reverend person in this court;                         220
    But by particular consent proceeded
    Under your hands and seals: therefore, go on;
    For no dislike i' the world against the person
    Of the good queen, but the sharp thorny points[432]
    Of my alleged reasons, drive this forward:[433]                  225
    Prove but our marriage lawful, by my life
    And kingly dignity, we are contented
    To wear our mortal state to come with her,
    Katharine our queen, before the primest creature
    That's paragon'd o' the world.[434]

    _Cam._                         So please your highness,          230
    The queen being absent, 'tis a needful fitness
    That we adjourn this court till further day:[435]
    Meanwhile must be an earnest motion
    Made to the queen, to call back her appeal
    She intends unto his holiness.

    _King._              [_Aside_] I may perceive[436][437]          235
    These cardinals trifle with me: I abhor[437]
    This dilatory sloth and tricks of Rome.[437][438]
    My learn'd and well-beloved servant, Cranmer,[437][439]
    Prithee, return; with thy approach, I know,[437][440]
    My comfort comes along.--Break up the court:[437]                240
    I say, set on.

                                    [_Exeunt in manner as they entered._

ACT III.


SCENE I. _London. The Queen's apartments._

            _The_ QUEEN _and her_ Women, _as at work_.[441]

    _Q. Kath._ Take thy lute, wench: my soul grows sad with troubles;[442]
    Sing, and disperse 'em, if thou canst: leave working.[443]

                                SONG.

                Orpheus with his lute made trees,
                And the mountain tops that freeze,
                  Bow themselves when he did sing;                     5
                To his music plants and flowers
                Ever sprung, as sun and showers[444]
                  There had made a lasting spring.[445]

                Every thing that heard him play,
                Even the billows of the sea,                          10
                  Hung their heads, and then lay by.
                In sweet music is such art,
                Killing care and grief of heart[446]
                  Fall asleep, or hearing die.

                          _Enter a_ Gentleman.

    _Q. Kath._ How now!                                               15

    _Gent._ An't please your grace, the two great cardinals[447]
    Wait in the presence.

    _Q. Kath._            Would they speak with me?

    _Gent._ They will'd me say so, madam.

    _Q. Kath._                            Pray their graces
    To come near. [_Exit Gent._] What can be their business[448]
    With me, a poor weak woman, fall'n from favour?                   20
    I do not like their coming. Now I think on't,[449]
    They should be good men, their affairs as righteous:[450]
    But all hoods make not monks.

         _Enter the two_ CARDINALS, WOLSEY _and_ CAMPEIUS.[451]

    _Wol._                        Peace to your highness!

    _Q. Kath._ Your graces find me here part of a housewife;
    I would be all, against the worst may happen.[452]                25
    What are your pleasures with me, reverend lords?[453]

    _Wol._ May it please you, noble madam, to withdraw
    Into your private chamber, we shall give you
    The full cause of our coming.

    _Q. Kath._                    Speak it here;
    There's nothing I have done yet, o' my conscience,                30
    Deserves a corner: would all other women
    Could speak this with as free a soul as I do!
    My lords, I care not, so much I am happy
    Above a number, if my actions
    Were tried by every tongue, every eye saw 'em,                    35
    Envy and base opinion set against 'em,
    I know my life so even. If your business[454]
    Seek me out, and that way I am wife in,[454][455]
    Out with it boldly: truth loves open dealing.

    _Wol._ Tanta est erga te mentis integritas, regina serenissima,--  40

    _Q. Kath._ O, good my lord, no Latin;[456]
    I am not such a truant since my coming,
    As not to know the language I have lived in:
    A strange tongue makes my cause more strange, suspicious;[457]    45
    Pray speak in English: here are some will thank you,
    If you speak truth, for their poor mistress' sake;
    Believe me, she has had much wrong: lord cardinal,
    The willing'st sin I ever yet committed
    May be absolved in English.

    _Wol._                      Noble lady,                           50
    I am sorry my integrity should breed,[458]
    And service to his majesty and you,[459]
    So deep suspicion, where all faith was meant.[459]
    We come not by the way of accusation,
    To taint that honour every good tongue blesses,                   55
    Nor to betray you any way to sorrow--
    You have too much, good lady--but to know
    How you stand minded in the weighty difference
    Between the king and you, and to deliver,
    Like free and honest men, our just opinions                       60
    And comforts to your cause.

    _Cam._                      Most honour'd madam,[460]
    My Lord of York, out of his noble nature,
    Zeal and obedience he still bore your grace,
    Forgetting, like a good man, your late censure
    Both of his truth and him, which was too far,                     65
    Offers, as I do, in a sign of peace,
    His service and his counsel.

    _Q. Kath._    [_Aside_] To betray me.--[461]
    My lords, I thank you both for your good wills;
    Ye speak like honest men; pray God, ye prove so!
    But how to make ye suddenly an answer,                            70
    In such a point of weight, so near mine honour,
    More near my life, I fear, with my weak wit,
    And to such men of gravity and learning,
    In truth, I know not. I was set at work
    Among my maids, full little, God knows, looking                   75
    Either for such men or such business.
    For her sake that I have been--for I feel
    The last fit of my greatness--good your graces,
    Let me have time and counsel for my cause:[462]
    Alas, I am a woman, friendless, hopeless!                         80

    _Wol._ Madam, you wrong the king's love with these fears:[463]
    Your hopes and friends are infinite.

    _Q. Kath._                           In England[464]
    But little for my profit: can you think, lords,[465]
    That any Englishman dare give me counsel?
    Or be a known friend, 'gainst his highness' pleasure--[466]       85
    Though he be grown so desperate to be honest--
    And live a subject? Nay, forsooth, my friends,[467]
    They that must weigh out my afflictions,[468]
    They that my trust must grow to, live not here:
    They are, as all my other comforts, far hence[469]                90
    In mine own country, lords.

    _Cam._                      I would your grace
    Would leave your griefs, and take my counsel.

    _Q. Kath._                                    How, sir?

    _Cam._ Put your main cause into the king's protection;
    He's loving and most gracious: 'twill be much
    Both for your honour better and your cause;[470]                  95
    For if the trial of the law o'ertake ye,
    You'll part away disgraced.

    _Wol._                      He tells you rightly.

    _Q. Kath._ Ye tell me what ye wish for both, my ruin:
    Is this your Christian counsel? out upon ye!
    Heaven is above all yet; there sits a judge                      100
    That no king can corrupt.

    _Cam._                    Your rage mistakes us.[471]

    _Q. Kath._ The more shame for ye: holy men I thought ye,[472]
    Upon my soul, two reverend cardinal virtues;
    But cardinal sins and hollow hearts I fear ye:[472][473]
    Mend 'em, for shame, my lords. Is this your comfort?[474]        105
    The cordial that ye bring a wretched lady,
    A woman lost among ye, laugh'd at, scorn'd?
    I will not wish ye half my miseries;
    I have more charity: but say, I warn'd ye;
    Take heed, for heaven's sake, take heed, lest at once[475]       110
    The burthen of my sorrows fall upon ye.

    _Wol._ Madam, this is a mere distraction;[476]
    You turn the good we offer into envy.

    _Q. Kath._ Ye turn me into nothing: woe upon ye,
    And all such false professors! would you have me--               115
    If you have any justice, any pity,
    If ye be any thing but churchmen's habits--[477]
    Put my sick cause into his hands that hates me?
    Alas, has banish'd me his bed already,[478]
    His love, too long ago! I am old, my lords,[479]                 120
    And all the fellowship I hold now with him
    Is only my obedience. What can happen[480]
    To me above this wretchedness? all your studies
    Make me a curse like this.

    _Cam._                     Your fears are worse.[481]

    _Q. Kath._ Have I lived thus long--let me speak myself,          125
    Since virtue finds no friends--a wife, a true one?
    A woman, I dare say without vain-glory,
    Never yet branded with suspicion?
    Have I with all my full affections
    Still met the king? loved him next heaven? obey'd him?           130
    Been, out of fondness, superstitious to him?
    Almost forgot my prayers to content him?
    And am I thus rewarded? 'tis not well, lords.
    Bring me a constant woman to her husband,
    One that ne'er dream'd a joy beyond his pleasure,                135
    And to that woman, when she has done most,
    Yet will I add an honour, a great patience.

    _Wol._ Madam, you wander from the good we aim at.[476][482]

    _Q. Kath._ My lord, I dare not make myself so guilty,[483]
    To give up willingly that noble title                            140
    Your master wed me to: nothing but death
    Shall e'er divorce my dignities.

    _Wol._                           Pray, hear me.[484]

    Q. Kath. Would I had never trod this English earth,
    Or felt the flatteries that grow upon it!
    Ye have angels' faces, but heaven knows your hearts.[485]        145
    What will become of me now, wretched lady![486]
    I am the most unhappy woman living.
    Alas, poor wenches, where are now your fortunes![487]
    Shipwreck'd upon a kingdom, where no pity,
    No friends, no hope; no kindred weep for me;                     150
    Almost no grave allow'd me: like the lily,
    That once was mistress of the field and flourish'd,
    I'll hang my head and perish.

    _Wol._                        If your grace[476]
    Could but be brought to know our ends are honest,
    You'ld feel more comfort: why should we, good lady,[488]         155
    Upon what cause, wrong you? alas, our places,
    The way of our profession is against it:
    We are to cure such sorrows, not to sow 'em.[489]
    For goodness' sake, consider what you do;
    How you may hurt yourself, ay, utterly[490]                      160
    Grow from the king's acquaintance, by this carriage.
    The hearts of princes kiss obedience,
    So much they love it; but to stubborn spirits
    They swell, and grow as terrible as storms.[491]
    I know you have a gentle, noble temper,[492]                     165
    A soul as even as a calm: pray think us
    Those we profess, peace-makers, friends and servants.

    _Cam._ Madam, you'll find it so. You wrong your virtues[493]
    With these weak women's fears: a noble spirit,
    As yours was put into you, ever casts                            170
    Such doubts, as false coin, from it. The king loves you;[494]
    Beware you lose it not: for us, if you please[495]
    To trust us in your business, we are ready
    To use our utmost studies in your service.

    _Q. Kath._ Do what ye will, my lords: and pray forgive
                me,[496][497]  175
    If I have used myself unmannerly;[497]
    You know I am a woman, lacking wit
    To make a seemly answer to such persons.
    Pray do my service to his majesty:
    He has my heart yet, and shall have my prayers                   180
    While I shall have my life. Come, reverend fathers.
    Bestow your counsels on me: she now begs
    That little thought, when she set footing here,
    She should have bought her dignities so dear.             [_Exeunt._


SCENE II. _Ante-chamber to the King's apartment._

   _Enter the_ DUKE OF NORFOLK, _the_ DUKE OF SUFFOLK, _the_ EARL OF
                SURREY, _and the_ LORD CHAMBERLAIN.[498]

    _Nor._ If you will now unite in your complaints
    And force them with a constancy, the cardinal
    Cannot stand under them: if you omit
    The offer of this time, I cannot promise
    But that you shall sustain moe new disgraces,[499]                 5
    With these you bear already.

    _Sur._                       I am joyful
    To meet the least occasion that may give me
    Remembrance of my father-in-law, the duke,
    To be revenged on him.

    _Suf._                 Which of the peers
    Have uncontemn'd gone by him, or at least[500]                    10
    Strangely neglected? when did he regard[501]
    The stamp of nobleness in any person[502]
    Out of himself?[502]

    _Cham._         My lords, you speak your pleasures:
    What he deserves of you and me I know;
    What we can do to him, though now the time                        15
    Gives way to us, I much fear. If you cannot[503]
    Bar his access to the king, never attempt
    Any thing on him; for he hath a witchcraft
    Over the king in's tongue.

    _Nor._                     O, fear him not;
    His spell in that is out: the king hath found                     20
    Matter against him that for ever mars
    The honey of his language. No, he's settled,
    Not to come off, in his displeasure.

    _Sur._                               Sir,[504]
    I should be glad to hear such news as this
    Once every hour.

    _Nor._           Believe it, this is true:                        25
    In the divorce his contrary proceedings
    Are all unfolded; wherein he appears
    As I would wish mine enemy.[505]

    _Sur._                      How came
    His practices to light?

    _Suf._            Most strangely.

    _Sur._                            O, how, how?[506]

    _Suf._ The cardinal's letters to the pope miscarried,[507]        30
    And came to the eye o' the king: wherein was read[508]
    How that the cardinal did entreat his holiness
    To stay the judgement o' the divorce; for if
    It did take place, 'I do' quoth he 'perceive
    My king is tangled in affection to                                35
    A creature of the queen's, Lady Anne Bullen.'

    _Sur._ Has the king this?

    _Suf._                    Believe it.

    _Sur._                                Will this work?[509]

    _Cham._ The king in this perceives him, how he coasts
    And hedges his own way. But in this point[510]
    All his tricks founder, and he brings his physic                  40
    After his patient's death: the king already
    Hath married the fair lady.

    _Sur._                      Would he had!

    _Suf._ May you be happy in your wish, my lord![511]
    For, I profess, you have it.

    _Sur._                       Now, all my joy[512]
    Trace the conjunction!

    _Suf._                 My amen to't!

    _Nor._                               All men's!                   45

    _Suf._ There's order given for her coronation:
    Marry, this is yet but young, and may be left[513]
    To some ears unrecounted. But, my lords,
    She is a gallant creature and complete
    In mind and feature: I persuade me, from her                      50
    Will fall some blessing to this land, which shall
    In it be memorized.

    _Sur._              But will the king
    Digest this letter of the cardinal's?[514]
    The Lord forbid![515]

    _Nor._    Marry, amen!

    _Suf._                 No, no;
    There be moe wasps that buzz about his nose[516]                  55
    Will make this sting the sooner. Cardinal Campeius
    Is stol'n away to Rome; hath ta'en no leave;[517]
    Has left the cause o' the king unhandled, and[518]
    Is posted as the agent of our cardinal,
    To second all his plot. I do assure you                           60
    The king cried 'Ha!' at this.

    _Cham._                       Now God incense him,
    And let him cry 'Ha!' louder!

    _Nor._                        But, my lord,
    When returns Cranmer?

    _Suf._ He is return'd in his opinions, which[519]
    Have satisfied the king for his divorce,                          65
    Together with all famous colleges[520]
    Almost in Christendom: shortly, I believe,
    His second marriage shall be publish'd, and
    Her coronation. Katharine no more
    Shall be call'd queen, but princess dowager                       70
    And widow to Prince Arthur.[521]

    _Nor._                      This same Cranmer's
    A worthy fellow, and hath ta'en much pain[522]
    In the king's business.

    _Suf._                  He has; and we shall see him
    For it an archbishop.

    _Nor._                So I hear.

    _Suf._                           'Tis so.
    The cardinal!

                     _Enter_ WOLSEY _and_ CROMWELL.

    _Nor._        Observe, observe, he's moody.[523]                  75

    _Wol._ The packet, Cromwell,[524]
    Gave 't you the king?[524]

    _Crom._               To his own hand, in's bedchamber.[525]

    _Wol._ Look'd he o' the inside of the paper?[526]

    _Crom._                                      Presently
    He did unseal them, and the first he view'd,
    He did it with a serious mind; a heed                             80
    Was in his countenance. You he bade[527]
    Attend him here this morning.[528]

    _Wol._                        Is he ready[528]
    To come abroad?[528]

    _Crom._         I think, by this he is.[528]

    _Wol._ Leave me awhile.                            [_Exit Cromwell._
    [_Aside_] It shall be to the Duchess of Alençon,[529]             85
    The French king's sister: he shall marry her.
    Anne Bullen! No; I'll no Anne Bullens for him:
    There's more in't than fair visage. Bullen![530]
    No, we'll no Bullens. Speedily I wish
    To hear from Rome. The Marchioness of Pembroke!                   90

    _Nor._ He's discontented.

    _Suf._                    May be, he hears the king
    Does whet his anger to him.

    _Sur._                      Sharp enough.
    Lord, for thy justice!

    _Wol._ [_Aside_] The late queen's gentlewoman, a knight's
                    daughter,[529][531]
    To be her mistress' mistress! the queen's queen!                  95
    This candle burns not clear: 'tis I must snuff it;
    Then out it goes. What though I know her virtuous
    And well deserving? yet I know her for
    A spleeny Lutheran, and not wholesome to
    Our cause, that she should lie i' the bosom of[532]              100
    Our hard-ruled king. Again, there is sprung up[532]
    An heretic, an arch one, Cranmer, one
    Hath crawl'd into the favour of the king,
    And is his oracle.

    _Nor._             He is vex'd at something.[533]

    _Sur._ I would 'twere something that would fret the string,[534]  105
    The master-cord on's heart![535]

           _Enter_ KING, _reading of a schedule, and_ LOVELL.

    _Suf._                      The king, the king!

    _King._ What piles of wealth hath he accumulated
    To his own portion! and what expense by the hour[536]
    Seems to flow from him! How, i' the name of thrift,
    Does he rake this together! Now, my lords,                       110
    Saw you the cardinal?

    _Nor._                My lord, we have
    Stood here observing him: some strange commotion
    Is in his brain: he bites his lip, and starts;[537]
    Stops on a sudden, looks upon the ground,
    Then lays his finger on his temple; straight                     115
    Springs out into fast gait; then stops again,
    Strikes his breast hard, and anon he casts[538][539]
    His eye against the moon: in most strange postures[539]
    We have seen him set himself.[539][540]

    _King._                       It may well be;[541]
    There is a mutiny in's mind. This morning[541]                   120
    Papers of state he sent me to peruse,
    As I required: and wot you what I found
    There, on my conscience, put unwittingly?
    Forsooth, an inventory, thus importing,
    The several parcels of his plate, his treasure,                  125
    Rich stuffs, and ornaments of household, which
    I find at such proud rate that it out-speaks[542]
    Possession of a subject.

    _Nor._                   It's heaven's will:
    Some spirit put this paper in the packet,
    To bless your eye withal.

    _King._                   If we did think,                       130
    His contemplation were above the earth,[543]
    And fix'd on spiritual object, he should still[544]
    Dwell in his musings: but I am afraid
    His thinkings are below the moon, not worth[545]
    His serious considering.

                             [_King takes his seat; whispers Lovell, who
                                                  goes to the Cardinal._

    _Wol._                   Heaven forgive me!                      135
    Ever God bless your highness!

    _King._                       Good my lord,
    You are full of heavenly stuff, and bear the inventory
    Of your best graces in your mind; the which[546]
    You were now running o'er: you have scarce time
    To steal from spiritual leisure a brief span[547]                140
    To keep your earthly audit: sure, in that
    I deem you an ill husband, and am glad[548]
    To have you therein my companion.

    _Wol._                            Sir,
    For holy offices I have a time; a time[549]
    To think upon the part of business which[550]                    145
    I bear i' the state; and nature does require
    Her times of preservation, which perforce
    I, her frail son, amongst my brethren mortal,
    Must give my tendance to.

    _King._                    You have said well.

    _Wol._ And ever may your highness yoke together,                 150
    As I will lend you cause, my doing well
    With my well saying!

    _King._              'Tis well said again;
    And 'tis a kind of good deed to say well:
    And yet words are no deeds. My father loved you:
    He said he did, and with his deed did crown[551]                 155
    His word upon you. Since I had my office,[552]
    I have kept you next my heart; have not alone
    Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
    But pared my present havings, to bestow
    My bounties upon you.

    _Wol._                [_Aside_] What should this mean?[553]      160

    _Sur._ [_Aside_] The Lord increase this business![553]

    _King._                                          Have I not made you
    The prime man of the state? I pray you, tell me,
    If what I now pronounce you have found true:
    And, if you may confess it, say withal,
    If you are bound to us or no. What say you?                      165

    _Wol._ My sovereign, I confess your royal graces,
    Shower'd on me daily, have been more than could
    My studied purposes requite; which went[554]
    Beyond all man's endeavours: my endeavours[555]
    Have ever come too short of my desires,                          170
    Yet filed with my abilities: mine own ends[556]
    Have been mine so that evermore they pointed[557]
    To the good of your most sacred person and
    The profit of the state. For your great graces
    Heap'd upon me, poor undeserver, I                               175
    Can nothing render but allegiant thanks,
    My prayers to heaven for you, my loyalty,
    Which ever has and ever shall be growing[558]
    Till death, that winter, kill it.

    _King._                           Fairly answer'd;
    A loyal and obedient subject is                                  180
    Therein illustrated: the honour of it
    Does pay the act of it; as, i' the contrary,[559]
    The foulness is the punishment. I presume
    That, as my hand has open'd bounty to you,
    My heart dropp'd love, my power rain'd honour, more              185
    On you than any; so your hand and heart,
    Your brain and every function of your power,
    Should, notwithstanding that your bond of duty,
    As 'twere in love's particular, be more
    To me, your friend, than any.

    _Wol._                        I do profess[560]                  190
    That for your highness' good I ever labour'd
    More than mine own; that am, have, and will be--[561]
    Though all the world should crack their duty to you,[562]
    And throw it from their soul; though perils did
    Abound, as thick as thought could make 'em, and[563]             195
    Appear in forms more horrid--yet my duty,
    As doth a rock against the chiding flood,
    Should the approach of this wild river break,
    And stand unshaken yours.

    _King._                   'Tis nobly spoken.
    Take notice, lords, he has a loyal breast,                       200
    For you have seen him open't. [_Giving him papers._] Read
                o'er this;[564]
    And after, this: and then to breakfast with
    What appetite you have.[565]

                     [_Exit King, frowning upon the Cardinal: the nobles
                              throng after him, smiling and whispering._

    _Wol._                  What should this mean?
    What sudden anger's this? how have I reap'd it?[566]
    He parted frowning from me, as if ruin                           205
    Leap'd from his eyes. So looks the chafed lion
    Upon the daring huntsman that has gall'd him;
    Then makes him nothing. I must read this paper;
    I fear, the story of his anger. 'Tis so;[567]
    This paper has undone me: 'tis the account                       210
    Of all that world of wealth I have drawn together[568]
    For mine own ends; indeed, to gain the popedom,
    And fee my friends in Rome. O negligence![569]
    Fit for a fool to fall by: what cross devil[569]
    Made me put this main secret in the packet                       215
    I sent the king? Is there no way to cure this?
    No new device to beat this from his brains?
    I know 'twill stir him strongly; yet I know
    A way, if it take right, in spite of fortune
    Will bring me off again. What's this? 'To the Pope!'             220
    The letter, as I live, with all the business
    I writ to's holiness. Nay then, farewell![570]
    I have touch'd the highest point of all my greatness;[570]
    And, from that full meridian of my glory,
    I haste now to my setting: I shall fall                          225
    Like a bright exhalation in the evening.
    And no man see me more.[571]

    _Re-enter to_ WOLSEY _the_ DUKES OF NORFOLK _and_ SUFFOLK, _the_
              EARL OF SURREY, _and the_ LORD CHAMBERLAIN.

    _Nor._ Hear the king's pleasure, cardinal: who commands you[572]
    To render up the great seal presently
    Into our hands; and to confine yourself                          230
    To Asher-house, my Lord of Winchester's,[573]
    Till you hear further from his highness.

    _Wol._                                   Stay:
    Where's your commission, lords? words cannot carry[574]
    Authority so weighty.[575]

    _Suf._                Who dare cross 'em,
    Bearing the king's will from his mouth expressly?                235

    _Wol._ Till I find more than will or words to do it--[576]
    I mean your malice--know, officious lords,
    I dare, and must deny it. Now I feel
    Of what coarse metal ye are moulded--envy:[577]
    How eagerly ye follow my disgraces,[578]                         240
    As if it fed ye! and how sleek and wanton[579]
    Ye appear in every thing may bring my ruin![580]
    Follow your envious courses, men of malice;[580]
    You have Christian warrant for 'em, and, no doubt,[581]
    In time will find their fit rewards. That seal                   245
    You ask with such a violence, the king,[582]
    Mine and your master, with his own hand gave me;
    Bade me enjoy it, with the place and honours,
    During my life; and, to confirm his goodness,
    Tied it by letters-patents: now, who'll take it?[583]            250

    _Sur._ The king, that gave it.

    _Wol._                         It must be himself, then.

    _Sur._ Thou art a proud traitor, priest.[584]

    _Wol._                                   Proud lord, thou liest:
    Within these forty hours Surrey durst better[585]
    Have burnt that tongue than said so.

    _Sur._                               Thy ambition,
    Thou scarlet sin, robb'd this bewailing land                     255
    Of noble Buckingham, my father-in-law:
    The heads of all thy brother cardinals,
    With thee and all thy best parts bound together,
    Weigh'd not a hair of his. Plague of your policy!
    You sent me deputy for Ireland;                                  260
    Far from his succour, from the king, from all
    That might have mercy on the fault thou gavest him;
    Whilst your great goodness, out of holy pity,
    Absolved him with an axe.

    _Wol._                    This, and all else
    This talking lord can lay upon my credit,                        265
    I answer, is most false. The duke by law
    Found his deserts. How innocent I was
    From any private malice in his end,
    His noble jury and foul cause can witness.
    If I loved many words, lord, I should tell you                   270
    You have as little honesty as honour,[586]
    That in the way of loyalty and truth[587]
    Toward the king, my ever royal master,
    Dare mate a sounder man than Surrey can be,[588]
    And all that love his follies.

    _Sur._                         By my soul,                       275
    Your long coat, priest, protects you; thou shouldst feel[589]
    My sword i' the life-blood of thee else. My lords,
    Can ye endure to hear this arrogance?
    And from this fellow? If we live thus tamely,
    To be thus jaded by a piece of scarlet,[590]                     280
    Farewell nobility; let his grace go forward,
    And dare us with his cap like larks.[591]

    _Wol._                               All goodness
    Is poison to thy stomach.

    _Sur._                    Yes, that goodness
    Of gleaning all the land's wealth into one,
    Into your own hands, cardinal, by extortion;                     285
    The goodness of your intercepted packets
    You writ to the pope against the king: your goodness,
    Since you provoke me, shall be most notorious.
    My Lord of Norfolk, as you are truly noble,[592]
    As you respect the common good, the state                        290
    Of our despised nobility, our issues,
    Who, if he live, will scarce be gentlemen,[593]
    Produce the grand sum of his sins, the articles
    Collected from his life. I'll startle you
    Worse than the sacring bell, when the brown wench[594]           295
    Lay kissing in your arms, lord cardinal.

    _Wol._ How much, methinks, I could despise this man.
    But that I am bound in charity against it![595]

    _Nor._ Those articles, my lord, are in the king's hand:
    But, thus much, they are foul ones.

    _Wol._                              So much fairer               300
    And spotless shall mine innocence arise,
    When the king knows my truth.

    _Sur._                        This cannot save you:[596]
    I thank my memory, I yet remember
    Some of these articles, and out they shall.
    Now, if you can blush and cry 'guilty,' cardinal,[597]           305
    You'll show a little honesty.

    _Wol._                        Speak on, sir;
    I dare your worst objections: if I blush,
    It is to see a nobleman want manners.

    _Sur._ I had rather want those than my head. Have at you![598]
    First that, without the king's assent or knowledge,              310
    You wrought to be a legate; by which power
    You maim'd the jurisdiction of all bishops.

    _Nor._ Then that in all you writ to Rome, or else
    To foreign princes, 'Ego et Rex meus'
    Was still inscribed; in which you brought the king               315
    To be your servant.

    _Suf._              Then that, without the knowledge[599]
    Either of king or council, when you went
    Ambassador to the emperor, you made bold
    To carry into Flanders the great seal.

    _Sur._ Item, you sent a large commission                         320
    To Gregory de Cassado, to conclude,[600]
    Without the king's will or the state's allowance,
    A league between his highness and Ferrara.[601]

    _Suf._ That, out of mere ambition, you have caused
    Your holy hat to be stamp'd on the king's coin.[602]             325

    _Sur._ Then that you have sent innumerable substance--[599][603]
    By what means got, I leave to your own conscience--
    To furnish Rome and to prepare the ways
    You have for dignities, to the mere undoing[604]
    Of all the kingdom. Many more there are;                         330
    Which, since they are of you and odious,
    I will not taint my mouth with.

    _Cham._                         O my lord!
    Press not a falling man too far; 'tis virtue:
    His faults lie open to the laws; let them,
    Not you, correct him. My heart weeps to see him                  335
    So little of his great self.

    _Sur._                       I forgive him.

    _Suf._ Lord cardinal, the king's further pleasure is--
    Because all those things you have done of late,
    By your power legatine, within this kingdom,[605]
    Fall into the compass of a præmunire--[606]                      340
    That therefore such a writ be sued against you;
    To forfeit all your goods, lands, tenements,
    Chattels, and whatsoever, and to be[607]
    Out of the king's protection. This is my charge.[608]

    _Nor._ And so we'll leave you to your meditations                345
    How to live better. For your stubborn answer
    About the giving back the great seal to us,
    The king shall know it, and, no doubt, shall thank you.
    So fare you well, my little good lord cardinal.

                                              [_Exeunt all but Wolsey._

    _Wol._ So farewell to the little good you bear me.[609]          350
    Farewell! a long farewell, to all my greatness![610]
    This is the state of man: to-day he puts forth
    The tender leaves of hopes; to-morrow blossoms,[611]
    And bears his blushing honours thick upon him;
    The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,                    355
    And, when he thinks, good easy man, full surely
    His greatness is a-ripening, nips his root,[612]
    And then he falls, as I do. I have ventured,
    Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders,
    This many summers in a sea of glory,[613]                        360
    But far beyond my depth: my high-blown pride[614]
    At length broke under me and now has left me,
    Weary and old with service, to the mercy
    Of a rude stream that must for ever hide me.
    Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye:[615]               365
    I feel my heart new open'd. O, how wretched
    Is that poor man that hangs on princes' favours!
    There is, betwixt that smile we would aspire to,[616]
    That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin,[617]
    More pangs and fears than wars or women have:                    370
    And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,
    Never to hope again.

              _Enter_ CROMWELL, _and stands amazed_.[618]

                         Why, how now, Cromwell!

    _Crom._ I have no power to speak, sir.

    _Wol._                                 What, amazed
    At my misfortunes? can thy spirit wonder[619]
    A great man should decline? Nay, an you weep,[620]               375
    I am fall'n indeed.

    _Crom._             How does your grace?

    _Wol._                                   Why, well;
    Never so truly happy, my good Cromwell.
    I know myself now; and I feel within me
    A peace above all earthly dignities,
    A still and quiet conscience. The king has cured me,             380
    I humbly thank his grace; and from these shoulders,
    These ruin'd pillars, out of pity, taken[621]
    A load would sink a navy, too much honour.
    O, 'tis a burden, Cromwell, 'tis a burden
    Too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven!                       385

    _Crom._ I am glad your grace has made that right use of it.[595][622]

    _Wol._ I hope I have: I am able now, methinks,[622]
    Out of a fortitude of soul I feel,
    To endure more miseries and greater far
    Than my weak-hearted enemies dare offer.                         390
    What news abroad?

    _Crom._           The heaviest and the worst
    Is your displeasure with the king.

    _Wol._                             God bless him!

    _Crom._ The next is, that Sir Thomas More is chosen[623]
    Lord chancellor in your place.

    _Wol._                         That's somewhat sudden:
    But he's a learned man. May he continue                          395
    Long in his highness' favour, and do justice
    For truth's sake and his conscience; that his bones,[624]
    When he has run his course and sleeps in blessings,
    May have a tomb of orphans' tears wept on 'em![625]
    What more?

    _Crom._    That Cranmer is return'd with welcome,                400
    Install'd lord archbishop of Canterbury.

    _Wol._ That's news indeed.

    _Crom._                    Last, that the Lady Anne,
    Whom the king hath in secrecy long married,
    This day was view'd in open as his queen,
    Going to chapel; and the voice is now                            405
    Only about her coronation.

    _Wol._ There was the weight that pull'd me down. O Cromwell,[626]
    The king has gone beyond me: all my glories
    In that one woman I have lost for ever:
    No sun shall ever usher forth mine honours,                      410
    Or gild again the noble troops that waited
    Upon my smiles. Go, get thee from me, Cromwell;
    I am a poor fall'n man, unworthy now[627]
    To be thy lord and master: seek the king;
    That sun, I pray, may never set! I have told him[628]            415
    What and how true thou art: he will advance thee;
    Some little memory of me will stir him--
    I know his noble nature--not to let
    Thy hopeful service perish too: good Cromwell,
    Neglect him not; make use now, and provide                       420
    For thine own future safety.

    _Crom._                      O my lord,
    Must I then leave you? must I needs forego
    So good, so noble and so true a master?
    Bear witness, all that have not hearts of iron,
    With what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord.                     425
    The king shall have my service, but my prayers
    For ever and for ever shall be yours.

    _Wol._ Cromwell, I did not think to shed a tear
    In all my miseries; but thou hast forced me,
    Out of thy honest truth, to play the woman.                      430
    Let's dry our eyes: and thus far hear me, Cromwell;
    And, when I am forgotten, as I shall be,
    And sleep in dull cold marble, where no mention
    Of me more must be heard of, say, I taught thee,[629]
    Say, Wolsey, that once trod the ways of glory,[630]              435
    And sounded all the depths and shoals of honour,
    Found thee a way, out of his wreck, to rise in;
    A sure and safe one, though thy master miss'd it.
    Mark but my fall and that that ruin'd me.[631]
    Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition:                    440
    By that sin fell the angels; how can man then,
    The image of his Maker, hope to win by it?[632]
    Love thyself last: cherish those hearts that hate thee;[633]
    Corruption wins not more than honesty.[634]
    Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace,                      445
    To silence envious tongues. Be just, and fear not:
    Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's,
    Thy God's, and truth's; then if thou fall'st, O Cromwell,
    Thou fall'st a blessed martyr! Serve the king;[635][636]
    And prithee, lead me in:[635][636][637]                          450
    There take an inventory of all I have,[635][638]
    To the last penny; 'tis the king's: my robe,[635][638]
    And my integrity to heaven, is all[635]
    I dare now call mine own. O Cromwell, Cromwell!
    Had I but served my God with half the zeal                       455
    I served my king, he would not in mine age
    Have left me naked to mine enemies.

    _Crom._ Good sir, have patience.

    _Wol._                           So I have. Farewell
    The hopes of court! my hopes in heaven do dwell.

                                                              [_Exeunt._

ACT IV.


SCENE I. _A street in Westminster._

             _Enter two_ Gentlemen, _meeting one another_.

    _First Gent._ You're well met once again.

    _Sec. Gent._                              So are you.[639]

    _First Gent._ You come to take your stand here and behold
    The Lady Anne pass from her coronation?[640]

    _Sec. Gent._ 'Tis all my business. At our last encounter,
    The Duke of Buckingham came from his trial.                        5

    _First Gent._ 'Tis very true: but that time offer'd sorrow;
    This, general joy.

    _Sec. Gent._       'Tis well: the citizens,
    I am sure, have shown at full their royal minds--[641][642]
    As, let'em have their rights, they are ever forward--[642][643]
    In celebration of this day with shows,[644]                       10
    Pageants and sights of honour.

    _First Gent._                  Never greater,
    Nor, I'll assure you, better taken, sir.

    _Sec. Gent._ May I be bold to ask what that contains,[645]
    That paper in your hand?[646]

    _First Gent._            Yes; 'tis the list
    Of those that claim their offices this day                        15
    By custom of the coronation.
    The Duke of Suffolk is the first, and claims
    To be high-steward; next, the Duke of Norfolk,
    He to be earl marshal: you may read the rest.[647]

    _Sec. Gent._ I thank you, sir: had I not known those customs,[648]  20
    I should have been beholding to your paper.[649]
    But, I beseech you, what's become of Katharine,
    The princess dowager? how goes her business?

    _First Gent._ That I can tell you too. The Archbishop[650]
    Of Canterbury, accompanied with other                             25
    Learned and reverend fathers of his order,
    Held a late court at Dunstable, six miles off[651]
    From Ampthill, where the princess lay; to which
    She was often cited by them, but appear'd not:[652]
    And, to be short, for not appearance and[653]                     30
    The king's late scruple, by the main assent
    Of all these learned men she was divorced,
    And the late marriage made of none effect:
    Since which she was removed to Kimbolton,[654]
    Where she remains now sick.

    _Sec. Gent._                Alas, good lady!                      35

                                                       [_Trumpets._[655]

    The trumpets sound: stand close, the queen is coming.

                                                            [_Hautboys._

                      THE ORDER OF THE CORONATION.

    1. _A lively Flourish of Trumpets._

    2. _Then two_ Judges.

    3. LORD CHANCELLOR, _with purse and mace before him_.

    4. Choristers, _singing_. _Musicians._

    5. Mayor of London, _bearing the mace_. _Then_ Garter, _in his
        coat of arms, and on his head he wears a gilt copper crown_.

    6. MARQUESS DORSET, _bearing a sceptre of gold, on his head
        a demi-coronal of gold. With him, the_ EARL OF
        SURREY, _bearing the rod of silver with the dove,
        crowned with an earl's coronet. Collars of SS._

    7. DUKE OF SUFFOLK, _in his robe of estate, his coronet on his
        head, bearing a long white wand, as high-steward. With
        him, the_ DUKE OF NORFOLK, _with the rod of marshalship, a
        coronet on his head. Collars of SS._

    8. _A canopy borne by four of the Cinque-ports; under it, the_
        QUEEN _in her robe; in her hair richly adorned with pearl,
        crowned. On each side her, the_ BISHOPS OF LONDON _and_
        WINCHESTER.

    9. _The old_ DUCHESS OF NORFOLK, _in a coronal of gold,
        wrought with flowers, bearing the_ QUEEN'S _train_.

    10. _Certain_ Ladies _or_ Countesses, _with plain circlets of
        gold without flowers_.

          _They pass over the stage in order and state._[656]

    _Sec. Gent._ A royal train, believe me. These I know:
    Who's that that bears the sceptre?[657]

    _First Gent._                      Marquess Dorset:
    And that the Earl of Surrey, with the rod.

    _Sec. Gent._ A bold brave gentleman. That should be[658]          40
    The Duke of Suffolk?

    _First Gent._        'Tis the same: high-steward.

    _Sec. Gent._ And that my Lord of Norfolk?

    _First Gent._                             Yes.

    _Sec. Gent._     [_Looking on the Queen_] Heaven bless thee![659]
    Thou hast the sweetest face I ever look'd on.
    Sir, as I have a soul, she is an angel;
    Our king has all the Indies in his arms,                          45
    And more and richer, when he strains that lady:[660]
    I cannot blame his conscience.

    _First Gent._                  They that bear
    The cloth of honour over her, are four barons[661]
    Of the Cinque-ports.

    _Sec. Gent._ Those men are happy; and so are all are near her.[662]  50
    I take it, she that carries up the train
    Is that old noble lady, Duchess of Norfolk.[663]

    _First Gent._ It is; and all the rest are countesses.

    _Sec. Gent._ Their coronets say so. These are stars indeed,
    And sometimes falling ones.

    _First Gent._               No more of that.                      55

         [_Exit procession; and then a great flourish of trumpets._[664]

                       _Enter a third_ Gentleman.

    _First Gent._ God save you, sir! where have you been broiling?[665]

    _Third Gent._ Among the crowd i' the abbey; where a finger
    Could not be wedged in more: I am stifled[666]
    With the mere rankness of their joy.

    _Sec. Gent._                         You saw[667]
    The ceremony?[667]

    _Third Gent._ That I did.[668]

    _First Gent._             How was it?                             60

    _Third Gent._ Well worth the seeing.

    _See. Gent._                         Good sir, speak it to us.

    _Third Gent._ As well as I am able. The rich stream
    Of lords and ladies, having brought the queen
    To a prepared place in the choir, fell off
    A distance from her; while her grace sat down                     65
    To rest awhile, some half an hour or so,
    In a rich chair of state, opposing freely[669]
    The beauty of her person to the people.
    Believe me, sir, she is the goodliest woman
    That ever lay by man: which when the people                       70
    Had the full view of, such a noise arose
    As the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest,
    As loud and to as many tunes: hats, cloaks,--
    Doublets, I think,--flew up; and had their faces
    Been loose, this day they had been lost. Such joy                 75
    I never saw before. Great-bellied women,
    That had not half a week to go, like rams
    In the old time of war, would shake the press,
    And make 'em reel before 'em. No man living
    Could say 'This is my wife' there, all were woven[670]            80
    So strangely in one piece.

    _Sec. Gent._               But what follow'd?[671]

    _Third Gent._ At length her grace rose, and with modest paces
    Came to the altar, where she kneel'd and saintlike
    Cast her fair eyes to heaven and pray'd devoutly;
    Then rose again and bow'd her to the people;                      85
    When by the Archbishop of Canterbury
    She had all the royal makings of a queen,[672]
    As holy oil, Edward Confessor's crown,
    The rod, and bird of peace, and all such emblems
    Laid nobly on her: which perform'd, the choir,                    90
    With all the choicest music of the kingdom,
    Together sung 'Te Deum.' So she parted,
    And with the same full state paced back again
    To York-place, where the feast is held.

    _First Gent._                           Sir,[673]
    You must no more call it York-place; that's past;[673]            95
    For, since the cardinal fell, that title's lost:
    'Tis now the king's, and call'd Whitehall.

    _Third Gent._                              I know it;
    But 'tis so lately alter'd that the old name[674]
    Is fresh about me.

    _Sec. Gent._       What two reverend bishops
    Were those that went on each side of the queen?                  100

    _Third Gent._ Stokesly and Gardiner; the one of Winchester,[675]
    Newly preferr'd from the king's secretary,
    The other, London.

    _Sec. Gent._       He of Winchester
    Is held no great good lover of the archbishop's,[676]
    The virtuous Cranmer.

    _Third Gent._         All the land knows that:                   105
    However, yet there is no great breach; when it comes,[677]
    Cranmer will find a friend will not shrink from him.

    _Sec. Gent._ Who may that be, I pray you?

    _Third Gent._                             Thomas Cromwell;[678]
    A man in much esteem with the king, and truly[678]
    A worthy friend. The king has made him master[678][679][680]     110
    O' the jewel house,[678][679][681]
    And one, already, of the privy council.[679][681]

    _Sec. Gent._ He will deserve more.[681]

    _Third Gent._                      Yes, without all doubt.[681]
    Come, gentlemen, ye shall go my way,[682][683]
    Which is to the court, and there ye shall be my guests:[682][684]  115
    Something I can command. As I walk thither,
    I'll tell ye more.

    _Both._            You may command us, sir.               [_Exeunt._


SCENE II. _Kimbolton._

     _Enter_ KATHARINE, _Dowager, sick; led between_ GRIFFITH, _her
              Gentleman Usher, and_ PATIENCE, _her woman_.

    _Grif._ How does your grace?

    _Kath._                      O Griffith, sick to death!
    My legs, like loaden branches, bow to the earth,[685]
    Willing to leave their burthen. Reach a chair.
    So; now, methinks, I feel a little ease.[686]
    Didst thou not tell me, Griffith, as thou led'st me,[687]          5
    That the great child of honour, Cardinal Wolsey,
    Was dead?[688]

    _Grif._ Yes, madam; but I think your grace,
    Out of the pain you suffer'd, gave no ear to't.

    _Kath._ Prithee, good Griffith, tell me how he died:
    If well, he stepp'd before me, happily,[689]                      10
    For my example.

    _Grif._         Well, the voice goes, madam:
    For after the stout Earl Northumberland[690]
    Arrested him at York, and brought him forward,
    As a man sorely tainted, to his answer,
    He fell sick suddenly, and grew so ill                            15
    He could not sit his mule.

    _Kath._                    Alas, poor man!

    _Grif._ At last, with easy roads, he came to Leicester,
    Lodged in the abbey; where the reverend abbot,
    With all his covent, honourably received him;[691]
    To whom he gave these words, 'O father abbot,                     20
    An old man, broken with the storms of state,
    Is come to lay his weary bones among ye;
    Give him a little earth for charity!'
    So went to bed; where eagerly his sickness
    Pursued him still; and three nights after this,                   25
    About the hour of eight, which he himself
    Foretold should be his last, full of repentance,[692]
    Continual meditations, tears and sorrows,
    He gave his honours to the world again,[693]
    His blessed part to heaven, and slept in peace.                   30

    _Kath._ So may he rest; his faults lie gently on him![694]
    Yet thus far, Griffith, give me leave to speak him,
    And yet with charity. He was a man
    Of an unbounded stomach, ever ranking
    Himself with princes; one that by suggestion                      35
    Tied all the kingdom: simony was fair-play:[695]
    His own opinion was his law: i' the presence
    He would say untruths, and be ever double
    Both in his words and meaning: he was never,
    But where he meant to ruin, pitiful:                              40
    His promises were, as he then was, mighty;
    But his performance, as he is now, nothing:[696]
    Of his own body he was ill, and gave
    The clergy ill example.

    _Grif._                 Noble madam,
    Men's evil manners live in brass; their virtues                   45
    We write in water. May it please your highness
    To hear me speak his good now?

    _Kath._                        Yes, good Griffith;
    I were malicious else.

    _Grif._                This Cardinal,
    Though from an humble stock, undoubtedly
    Was fashion'd to much honour from his cradle.[697]                50
    He was a scholar, and a ripe and good one;
    Exceeding wise, fair-spoken and persuading:
    Lofty and sour to them that loved him not,
    But to those men that sought him, sweet as summer.
    And though he were unsatisfied in getting,                        55
    Which was a sin, yet in bestowing, madam,
    He was most princely: ever witness for him
    Those twins of learning that he raised in you,
    Ipswich and Oxford! one of which fell with him,[698]
    Unwilling to outlive the good that did it;[699]                   60
    The other, though unfinish'd, yet so famous,
    So excellent in art and still so rising,
    That Christendom shall ever speak his virtue.
    His overthrow heap'd happiness upon him;
    For then, and not till then, he felt himself,                     65
    And found the blessedness of being little:
    And, to add greater honours to his age
    Than man could give him, he died fearing God.

    _Kath._ After my death I wish no other herald,
    No other speaker of my living actions,                            70
    To keep mine honour from corruption,
    But such an honest chronicler as Griffith.
    Whom I most hated living, thou hast made me,
    With thy religious truth and modesty,
    Now in his ashes honour: peace be with him!                       75
    Patience, be near me still; and set me lower:
    I have not long to trouble thee. Good Griffith,
    Cause the musicians play me that sad note
    I named my knell, whilst I sit meditating[700]
    On that celestial harmony I go to.                                80

                                                [_Sad and solemn music._

    _Grif._ She is asleep: good wench, let's sit down quiet,
    For fear we wake her: softly, gentle Patience.

    _The vision. Enter, solemnly tripping one after another, six
        personages, clad in white robes, wearing on their heads
        garlands of bays, and golden vizards on their faces;
        branches of bays or palm in their hands. They first congee
        unto her, then dance; and, at certain changes, the first
        two hold a spare garland over her head; at which the other
        four make reverent curtsies; then the two that held the
        garland deliver the same to the other next two, who observe
        the same order in their changes, and holding the garland
        over her head: which done, they deliver the same garland
        to the last two, who likewise observe the same order: at
        which, as it were by inspiration, she makes in her sleep
        signs of rejoicing, and holdeth up her hands to heaven: and
        so in their dancing vanish, carrying the garland with them.
        The music continues._[701]

    _Kath._ Spirits of peace, where are ye? are ye all gone,[702]
    And leave me here in wretchedness behind ye?

    _Grif._ Madam, we are here.

    _Kath._                     It is not you I call for:             85
    Saw ye none enter since I slept?

    _Grif._                          None, madam.

    _Kath._ No? Saw you not even now a blessed troop
    Invite me to a banquet, whose bright faces
    Cast thousand beams upon me, like the sun?[703]
    They promised me eternal happiness,                               90
    And brought me garlands, Griffith, which I feel
    I am not worthy yet to wear: I shall, assuredly.[704]

    _Grif._ I am most joyful, madam, such good dreams
    Possess your fancy.

    _Kath._             Bid the music leave;
    They are harsh and heavy to me.                [_Music ceases._[705]

    _Pat._                          Do you note                       95
    How much her grace is alter'd on the sudden?
    How long her face is drawn? how pale she looks,
    And of an earthy cold? Mark her eyes![706]

    _Grif._ She is going, wench: pray, pray.

    _Pat._                                   Heaven comfort her!

                       _Enter a_ Messenger.[707]

    _Mess._ An't like your grace,--[708]

    _Kath._                         You are a saucy fellow:          100
    Deserve we no more reverence?

    _Grif._                       You are to blame,[709]
    Knowing she will not lose her wonted greatness,[710]
    To use so rude behaviour: go to, kneel.

    _Mess._ I humbly do entreat your highness' pardon;
    My haste made me unmannerly. There is staying                    105
    A gentleman, sent from the king, to see you.

    _Kath._ Admit him entrance, Griffith: but this fellow
    Let me ne'er see again.            [_Exeunt Griffith and Messenger._

               _Re-enter_ GRIFFITH, _with_ CAPUCIUS.[711]

                            If my sight fail not,
    You should be lord ambassador from the emperor,
    My royal nephew, and your name Capucius.[712]                    110

    _Cap._ Madam, the same; your servant.

    _Kath._                               O, my lord,
    The times and titles now are alter'd strangely
    With me since first you knew me. But, I pray you,[713]
    What is your pleasure with me?

    _Cap._                         Noble lady,
    First, mine own service to your grace; the next,                 115
    The king's request that I would visit you;
    Who grieves much for your weakness, and by me
    Sends you his princely commendations,
    And heartily entreats you take good comfort.

    _Kath._ O my good lord, that comfort comes too late,             120
    'Tis like a pardon after execution:
    That gentle physic, given in time, had cured me;
    But now I am past all comforts here but prayers.
    How does his highness?

    _Cap._                 Madam, in good health.

    _Kath._ So may he ever do! and ever flourish,                    125
    When I shall dwell with worms, and my poor name
    Banish'd the kingdom! Patience, is that letter,
    I caused you write, yet sent away?

    _Pat._                             No, madam.

                                        [_Giving it to Katharine._[714]

    _Kath._ Sir, I most humbly pray you to deliver[715]
    This to my lord the king.

    _Cap._                    Most willing, madam.[716]              130

    _Kath._ In which I have commended to his goodness
    The model of our chaste loves, his young daughter,--
    The dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her!--
    Beseeching him to give her virtuous breeding--
    She is young and of a noble modest nature:                       135
    I hope she will deserve well--and a little
    To love her for her mother's sake, that loved him,
    Heaven knows how dearly. My next poor petition[717]
    Is that his noble grace would have some pity
    Upon my wretched women, that so long                             140
    Have follow'd both my fortunes faithfully:
    Of which there is not one, I dare avow,--
    And now I should not lie--but will deserve,[718]
    For virtue and true beauty of the soul,
    For honesty and decent carriage,                                 145
    A right good husband, let him be a noble:[719]
    And, sure, those men are happy that shall have 'em.
    The last is, for my men; they are the poorest,[720]
    But poverty could never draw 'em from me;
    That they may have their wages duly paid 'em,                    150
    And something over to remember me by:[721]
    If heaven had pleased to have given me longer life[722]
    And able means, we had not parted thus.[723]
    These are the whole contents: and, good my lord,
    By that you love the dearest in this world,                      155
    As you wish Christian peace to souls departed,
    Stand these poor people's friend, and urge the king
    To do me this last right.

    _Cap._                    By heaven, I will,
    Or let me lose the fashion of a man!

    _Kath._ I thank you, honest lord. Remember me                    160
    In all humility unto his highness:
    Say his long trouble now is passing[724]
    Out of this world; tell him, in death I bless'd him,
    For so I will. Mine eyes grow dim. Farewell,
    My lord. Griffith, farewell. Nay, Patience,[725]                 165
    You must not leave me yet: I must to bed;
    Call in more women. When I am dead, good wench,[726]
    Let me be used with honour: strew me over
    With maiden flowers, that all the world may know
    I was a chaste wife to my grave: embalm me,                      170
    Then lay me forth: although unqueen'd, yet like
    A queen and daughter to a king, inter me.
    I can no more.                         [_Exeunt, leading Katharine._

ACT V.


SCENE I. _London. A gallery in the palace._[727]

     _Enter_ GARDINER, Bishop of Winchester, _a_ Page _with a torch
                 before him, met by_ SIR THOMAS LOVELL.

    _Gar._ It's one o'clock, boy, is't not?

    _Boy._                                  It hath struck.

    _Gar._ These should be hours for necessities,
    Not for delights; times to repair our nature
    With comforting repose, and not for us
    To waste these times. Good hour of night, Sir Thomas!
    Whither so late?                                                   5

    _Lov._           Came you from the king, my lord?[728]

    _Gar._ I did, Sir Thomas, and left him at primero[729]
    With the Duke of Suffolk.

    _Lov._                    I must to him too,
    Before he go to bed. I'll take my leave.

    _Gar._ Not yet, Sir Thomas Lovell. What's the matter?             10
    It seems you are in haste: an if there be[730]
    No great offence belongs to't, give your friend
    Some touch of your late business: affairs that walk,
    As they say spirits do, at midnight, have
    In them a wilder nature than the business                         15
    That seeks dispatch by day.

    _Lov._                      My lord, I love you;
    And durst commend a secret to your ear
    Much weightier than this work. The queen's in labour,[731]
    They say, in great extremity; and fear'd[732]
    She'll with the labour end.

    _Gar._                        The fruit she goes with[733]        20
    I pray for heartily, that it may find
    Good time, and live: but for the stock, Sir Thomas,
    I wish it grubb'd up now.

    _Lov._                    Methinks I could
    Cry the amen; and yet my conscience says[734]
    She's a good creature, and, sweet lady, does                      25
    Deserve our better wishes.

    _Gar._                     But, sir, sir,
    Hear me, Sir Thomas: you're a gentleman[735]
    Of mine own way; I know you wise, religious;[736]
    And, let me tell you, it will ne'er be well,
    'Twill not, Sir Thomas Lovell, take't of me,                      30
    Till Cranmer, Cromwell, her two hands, and she,
    Sleep in their graves.

    _Lov._                 Now, sir, you speak of two
    The most remark'd i' the kingdom. As for Cromwell,
    Beside that of the jewel house, is made master[737]
    O' the rolls, and the king's secretary; further, sir,[738]        35
    Stands in the gap and trade of moe preferments,[739]
    With which the time will load him. The archbishop[740]
    Is the king's hand and tongue; and who dare speak[741]
    One syllable against him?

    _Gar._                    Yes, yes, Sir Thomas,[742]
    There are that dare; and I myself have ventured                   40
    To speak my mind of him: and indeed this day,[743]
    Sir, I may tell it you, I think I have
    Incensed the lords o' the council that he is--[744]
    For so I know he is, they know he is--
    A most arch-heretic, a pestilence                                 45
    That does infect the land: with which they moved
    Have broken with the king; who hath so far
    Given ear to our complaint, of his great grace[745]
    And princely care foreseeing those fell mischiefs
    Our reasons laid before him, hath commanded[746]                  50
    To-morrow morning to the council-board
    He be convented. He's a rank weed, Sir Thomas,[747]
    And we must root him out. From your affairs
    I hinder you too long: good night, Sir Thomas.

    _Lov._ Many good nights, my lord: I rest your servant.            55

                                            [_Exeunt Gardiner and Page._

                    _Enter_ KING _and_ SUFFOLK.[748]

    _King._ Charles, I will play no more to-night;[749]
    My mind's not on't; you are too hard for me.

    _Suf._ Sir, I did never win of you before.

    _King._ But little, Charles,
    Nor shall not, when my fancy's on my play.[750]                   60
    Now, Lovell, from the queen what is the news?

    _Lov._ I could not personally deliver to her
    What you commanded me, but by her woman
    I sent your message; who return'd her thanks
    In the great'st humbleness, and desired your highness[751]        65
    Most heartily to pray for her.

    _King._                        What say'st thou, ha?
    To pray for her? what, is she crying out?

    _Lov._ So said her woman, and that her sufferance made
    Almost each pang a death.

    _King._                   Alas, good lady!

    _Suf._ God safely quit her of her burthen, and                    70
    With gentle travail, to the gladding of[752]
    Your highness with an heir!

    _King._                      'Tis midnight, Charles;
    Prithee, to bed; and in thy prayers remember
    The estate of my poor queen. Leave me alone;
    For I must think of that which company                            75
    Would not be friendly to.

    _Suf._                    I wish your highness
    A quiet night, and my good mistress will
    Remember in my prayers.

    _King._                 Charles, good night.        [_Exit Suffolk._

                    _Enter_ SIR ANTHONY DENNY.[753]

    Well, sir, what follows?

    _Den._ Sir, I have brought my lord the archbishop,                80
    As you commanded me.

    _King._              Ha! Canterbury?

    _Den._ Ay, my good lord.[754]

    _King._                  'Tis true: where is he, Denny?

    _Den._ He attends your highness' pleasure.

    _King._                                    Bring him to us.

                                                    [_Exit Denny._[755]

    _Lov._ [_Aside_] This is about that which the bishop spake:[756]
    I am happily come hither.[757]                                    85

                   _Re-enter_ DENNY, _with_ CRANMER.

    _King._ Avoid the gallery. [_Lovell seems to stay_] Ha!
                    I have said. Be gone.[758]
    What!                                    [_Exeunt Lovell and Denny._

    _Cran._ [_Aside_] I am fearful: wherefore frowns he thus?[759]
    'Tis his aspect of terror. All's not well.

    _King._ How now, my lord! you do desire to know[760]
    Wherefore I sent for you.[760]

    _Cran._                   [_Kneeling_] It is my duty[761]         90
    To attend your highness' pleasure.[762]

    _King._                            Pray you, arise,
    My good and gracious Lord of Canterbury.
    Come, you and I must walk a turn together;
    I have news to tell you: come, come, give me your hand.[763]
    Ah, my good lord, I grieve at what I speak,                       95
    And am right sorry to repeat what follows:
    I have, and most unwillingly, of late
    Heard many grievous, I do say, my lord,
    Grievous complaints of you; which, being consider'd,
    Have moved us and our council, that you shall                    100
    This morning come before us; where, I know,
    You cannot with such freedom purge yourself,
    But that, till further trial in those charges
    Which will require your answer, you must take
    Your patience to you and be well contented                       105
    To make your house our Tower: you a brother of us,[764]
    It fits we thus proceed, or else no witness
    Would come against you.

    _Cran._                 [_Kneeling_] I humbly thank your highness;[761]
    And am right glad to catch this good occasion
    Most throughly to be winnow'd, where my chaff                    110
    And corn shall fly asunder: for, I know,
    There's none stands under more calumnious tongues
    Than I myself, poor man.[765]

    _King._                  Stand up, good Canterbury:
    Thy truth and thy integrity is rooted
    In us, thy friend: give me thy hand, stand up:[766]              115
    Prithee, let's walk. Now, by my holidame,[767]
    What manner of man are you? My lord, I look'd
    You would have given me your petition, that
    I should have ta'en some pains to bring together
    Yourself and your accusers, and to have heard you,[768]          120
    Without indurance, further.

    _Cran._                     Most dread liege,
    The good I stand on is my truth and honesty:[769]
    If they shall fail, I, with mine enemies,[770]
    Will triumph o'er my person; which I weigh not,
    Being of those virtues vacant. I fear nothing                    125
    What can be said against me.[771]

    _King._                      Know you not
    How your state stands i’ the world, with the whole world?
    Your enemies are many, and not small; their practices[772]
    Must bear the same proportion; and not ever
    The justice and the truth o' the question carries                130
    The due o' the verdict with it: at what ease[773]
    Might corrupt minds procure knaves as corrupt
    To swear against you? Such things have been done.
    You are potently opposed, and with a malice[774]
    Of as great size. Ween you of better luck,                       135
    I mean, in perjured witness, than your master,
    Whose minister you are, whiles here he lived[775]
    Upon this naughty earth? Go to, go to;
    You take a precipice for no leap of danger,[776]
    And woo your own destruction.[777]

    _Cran._                       God and your majesty               140
    Protect mine innocence, or I fall into
    The trap is laid for me!

    _King._                  Be of good cheer;
    They shall no more prevail than we give way to.
    Keep comfort to you; and this morning see
    You do appear before them. If they shall chance,[778]            145
    In charging you with matters, to commit you,
    The best persuasions to the contrary
    Fail not to use, and with what vehemency
    The occasion shall instruct you: if entreaties
    Will render you no remedy, this ring                             150
    Deliver them, and your appeal to us
    There make before them. Look, the good man weeps![779]
    He's honest, on mine honour. God's blest mother!
    I swear he is true-hearted, and a soul
    None better in my kingdom. Get you gone,                         155
    And do as I have bid you. [_Exit Cranmer._] He has strangled[780][781]
    His language in his tears.[781][782]

                 _Enter_ Old Lady; LOVELL _following_.

    _Gent._                    [_Within_] Come back: what mean you?

    _Old L._ I'll not come back; the tidings that I bring
    Will make my boldness manners. Now, good angels
    Fly o'er thy royal head, and shade thy person                    160
    Under their blessed wings!

    _King._                    Now, by thy looks
    I guess thy message. Is the queen deliver'd?
    Say, ay, and of a boy.

    _Old L._               Ay, ay, my liege;
    And of a lovely boy: the God of heaven
    Both now and ever bless her! 'tis a girl,                        165
    Promises boys hereafter. Sir, your queen
    Desires your visitation, and to be
    Acquainted with this stranger: 'tis as like you
    As cherry is to cherry.

    _King._                 Lovell!

    _Lov._                          Sir?[783]

    _King._ Give her an hundred marks. I'll to the queen.[784]       170

                                                                [_Exit._

    _Old L._ An hundred marks! By this light, I 'll ha' more.[785]
    An ordinary groom is for such payment.
    I will have more, or scold it out of him.
    Said I for this, the girl was like to him?[786][787]
    I will have more, or else unsay't; and now,[786][788]            175
    While it is hot, I'll put it to the issue.      [_Exeunt._[786][789]


SCENE II. _Before the council-chamber._

                  Pursuivants, Pages, &c. _attending._

            _Enter_ CRANMER, Archbishop of Canterbury.[790]

    _Cran._ I hope I am not too late; and yet the gentleman[791]
    That was sent to me from the council pray'd me
    To make great haste. All fast? what means this? Ho!
    Who waits there? Sure, you know me?

                            _Enter_ Keeper.

    _Keep._                             Yes, my lord;
    But yet I cannot help you.[792]                                    5

    _Cran._ Why?[792]

                       _Enter_ DOCTOR BUTTS.[793]

    _Keep._ Your grace must wait till you be call'd for.[792]

    _Cran._                                                         So.

    _Butts._ [_Aside_] This is a piece of malice. I am glad[794]
    I came this way so happily: the king[795]
    Shall understand it presently.                              [_Exit._

    _Cran._                        [_Aside_] 'Tis Butts,[796]         10
    The king's physician: as he pass'd along,
    How earnestly he cast his eyes upon me!
    Pray heaven, he sound not my disgrace! For certain,[797]
    This is of purpose laid by some that hate me--
    God turn their hearts! I never sought their malice--              15
    To quench mine honour: they would shame to make me
    Wait else at door, a fellow-councillor,
    'Mong boys, grooms and lackeys. But their pleasures[798]
    Must be fulfill'd, and I attend with patience.[799]

           _Enter the_ KING _and_ BUTTS _at a window above_.

    _Butts._ I'll show your grace the strangest sight--[800]

    _King._                                      What's that, Butts?  20

    _Butts._ I think your highness saw this many a day.

    _King._ Body o' me, where is it?[801]

    _Butts._                         There, my lord:
    The high promotion of his grace of Canterbury;
    Who holds his state at door, 'mongst pursuivants,
    Pages and footboys.

    _King._             Ha! 'tis he, indeed:                          25
    Is this the honour they do one another?
    'Tis well there's one above 'em yet. I had thought[802]
    They had parted so much honesty among 'em,[803]
    At least good manners, as not thus to suffer
    A man of his place and so near our favour                         30
    To dance attendance on their lordships' pleasures,
    And at the door too, like a post with packets.
    By holy Mary, Butts, there's knavery:
    Let 'em alone, and draw the curtain close;
    We shall hear more anon.                         [_Exeunt._[804]  35


SCENE III. _The council-chamber._

    _Enter_ LORD CHANCELLOR, _places himself at the upper end of
        the table on the left hand; a seat being left void above
        him, as for_ CANTERBURY'S _seat_; DUKE OF SUFFOLK, DUKE
        OF NORFOLK, SURREY, LORD CHAMBERLAIN, GARDINER, _seat
        themselves in order on each side_. CROMWELL _at lower end,
        as secretary. Keeper at the door._[805]

    _Chan._ Speak to the business, master secretary:[806]
    Why are we met in council?[807]

    _Crom._                    Please your honours,
    The chief cause concerns his grace of Canterbury.[808]

    _Gar._ Has he had knowledge of it?

    _Crom._                            Yes.

    _Nor._                                  Who waits there?

    _Keep._ Without, my noble lords?

    _Gar._                           Yes.[809]

    _Keep._                               My lord archbishop;          5
    And has done half an hour, to know your pleasures.

    _Chan._ Let him come in.

    _Keep._                  Your grace may enter now.

                [_Cranmer enters and approaches the council-table._[810]

    _Chan._ My good lord archbishop, I'm very sorry
    To sit here at this present and behold
    That chair stand empty: but we all are men,                       10
    In our own natures frail and capable[811]
    Of our flesh; few are angels: out of which frailty[811][812]
    And want of wisdom, you, that best should teach us,
    Have misdemean'd yourself, and not a little,
    Toward the king first, then his laws, in filling                  15
    The whole realm, by your teaching and your chaplains--
    For so we are inform'd--with new opinions,
    Divers and dangerous; which are heresies,
    And, not reform'd, may prove pernicious.

    _Gar._ Which reformation must be sudden too,                      20
    My noble lords; for those that tame wild horses
    Pace 'em not in their hands to make 'em gentle,
    But stop their mouths with stubborn bits and spur 'em,
    Till they obey the manage. If we suffer,
    Out of our easiness and childish pity                             25
    To one man's honour, this contagious sickness,
    Farewell all physic: and what follows then?
    Commotions, uproars, with a general taint
    Of the whole state: as of late days our neighbours,
    The upper Germany, can dearly witness,                            30
    Yet freshly pitied in our memories.

    _Cran._ My good lords, hitherto, in all the progress
    Both of my life and office, I have labour'd,
    And with no little study, that my teaching
    And the strong course of my authority                             35
    Might go one way, and safely; and the end
    Was ever to do well: nor is there living,
    I speak it with a single heart, my lords,
    A man that more detests, more stirs against,[813]
    Both in his private conscience and his place,                     40
    Defacers of a public peace, than I do.[814]
    Pray heaven, the king may never find a heart
    With less allegiance in it! Men that make
    Envy and crooked malice nourishment
    Dare bite the best. I do beseech your lordships,                  45
    That, in this case of justice, my accusers,
    Be what they will, may stand forth face to face,
    And freely urge against me.

    _Suf._                      Nay, my lord,
    That cannot be: you are a councillor,
    And, by that virtue, no man dare accuse you.                      50

    _Gar._ My lord, because we have business of more moment,[815]
    We will be short with you. 'Tis his highness' pleasure,
    And our consent, for better trial of you,
    From hence you be committed to the Tower;
    Where, being but a private man again,                             55
    You shall know many dare accuse you boldly,
    More than, I fear, you are provided for.

    _Cran._ Ah, my good Lord of Winchester, I thank you;[816]
    You are always my good friend; if your will pass,
    I shall both find your lordship judge and juror,                  60
    You are so merciful. I see your end;
    'Tis my undoing. Love and meekness, lord,
    Become a churchman better than ambition:
    Win straying souls with modesty again,
    Cast none away. That I shall clear myself,                        65
    Lay all the weight ye can upon my patience,
    I make as little doubt as you do conscience
    In doing daily wrongs. I could say more,
    But reverence to your calling makes me modest.

    _Gar._ My lord, my lord, you are a sectary;                       70
    That's the plain truth: your painted gloss discovers,
    To men that understand you, words and weakness.[817]

    _Crom._ My Lord of Winchester, you are a little,[818]
    By your good favour, too sharp; men so noble,
    However faulty, yet should find respect                           75
    For what they have been: 'tis a cruelty[819]
    To load a falling man.

    _Gar._                 Good master secretary,[820]
    I cry your honour mercy; you may, worst
    Of all this table, say so.

    _Crom._                    Why, my lord?

    _Gar._ Do not I know you for a favourer                           80
    Of this new sect? ye are not sound.

    _Crom._                             Not sound?

    _Gar._ Not sound, I say.

    _Crom._                  Would you were half so honest!
    Men's prayers then would seek you, not their fears.

    _Gar._ I shall remember this bold language.

    _Crom._                                     Do.
    Remember your bold life too.

    _Chan._                      This is too much;[821]               85
    Forbear, for shame, my lords.

    _Gar._                        I have done.[822]

    _Crom._                                    And I.

    _Chan._ Then thus for you, my lord: it stands agreed,[823]
    I take it, by all voices, that forthwith
    You be convey'd to the Tower a prisoner;
    There to remain till the king's further pleasure                  90
    Be known unto us: are you all agreed, lords?[824]

    _All._ We are.

    _Cran._        Is there no other way of mercy.
    But I must needs to the Tower, my lords?

    _Gar._                                   What other
    Would you expect? you are strangely troublesome.[825]
    Let some o' the guard be ready there.

                          _Enter_ Guard.[826]

    _Cran._                                For me?                    95
    Must I go like a traitor thither?

    _Gar._                            Receive him,
    And see him safe i' the Tower.

    _Cran._                        Stay, good my lords,
    I have a little yet to say. Look there, my lords;
    By virtue of that ring, I take my cause
    Out of the gripes of cruel men, and give it                      100
    To a most noble judge, the king my master.

    _Cham._ This is the king's ring.[827]

    _Sur._                           'Tis no counterfeit.

    _Suf._ 'Tis the right ring, by heaven: I told ye all,[828]
    When we first put this dangerous stone a-rolling,
    'Twould fall upon ourselves.

    _Nor._                       Do you think, my lords,             105
    The king will suffer but the little finger
    Of this man to be vex'd?

    _Cham._                  'Tis now too certain:[827]
    How much more is his life in value with him?
    Would I were fairly out on't!

    _Crom._                       My mind gave me,
    In seeking tales and informations                                110
    Against this man, whose honesty the devil
    And his disciples only envy at,[829]
    Ye blew the fire that burns ye: now have at ye!

           _Enter_ KING, _frowning on them; takes his seat_.

    _Gar._ Dread sovereign, how much are we bound to heaven[830]
    In daily thanks, that gave us such a prince,                     115
    Not only good and wise, but most religious:
    One that, in all obedience, makes the church
    The chief aim of his honour; and, to strengthen
    That holy duty, out of dear respect,[831]
    His royal self in judgement comes to hear                        120
    The cause betwixt her and this great offender.

    _King._ You were ever good at sudden commendations,[832]
    Bishop of Winchester. But know, I come not
    To hear such flattery now, and in my presence[833][834]
    They are too thin and bare to hide offences.[834][835]           125
    To me you cannot reach you play the spaniel,[836]
    And think with wagging of your tongue to win me;
    But, whatsoe'er thou takest me for, I'm sure
    Thou hast a cruel nature and a bloody.
    [_To Cranmer_] Good man, sit down. Now let me see the
                    proudest[837][838]  130
    He, that dares most, but wag his finger at thee:[837]
    By all that's holy, he had better starve
    Than but once think this place becomes thee not.[839]

    _Sur._ May it please your grace,--

    _King._                            No, sir, it does not please me.
    I had thought I had had men of some understanding[840]           135
    And wisdom of my council; but I find none.
    Was it discretion, lords, to let this man,
    This good man,--few of you deserve that title,--
    This honest man, wait like a lousy footboy
    At chamber-door? and one as great as you are?                    140
    Why, what a shame was this! Did my commission
    Bid ye so far forget yourselves? I gave ye
    Power as he was a councillor to try him,
    Not as a groom: there's some of ye, I see,
    More out of malice than integrity,                               145
    Would try him to the utmost, had ye mean:[841]
    Which ye shall never have while I live.

    _Chan._                                 Thus far,[842]
    My most dread sovereign, may it like your grace
    To let my tongue excuse all. What was purposed
    Concerning his imprisonment, was rather,                         150
    If there be faith in men, meant for his trial
    And fair purgation to the world, than malice,
    I'm sure, in me.

    _King._          Well, well, my lords, respect him;
    Take him and use him well; he's worthy of it.
    I will say thus much for him, if a prince                        155
    May be beholding to a subject, I[843]
    Am, for his love and service, so to him.
    Make me no more ado, but all embrace him:[844]
    Be friends, for shame, my lords! My Lord of Canterbury,
    I have a suit which you must not deny me;                        160
    That is, a fair young maid that yet wants baptism;[845]
    You must be godfather, and answer for her.

    _Cran._ The greatest monarch now alive may glory
    In such an honour: how may I deserve it,
    That am a poor and humble subject to you?                        165

    _King._ Come, come, my lord, you'ld spare your[846]
    spoons: you shall have two noble partners with you; the[846]
    old Duchess of Norfolk, and Lady Marquess Dorset: will[846][847][848]
    these please you?[846][848]
    Once more, my Lord of Winchester, I charge you,                  170
    Embrace and love this man.[849]

    _Gar._                     With a true heart
    And brother-love I do it.[850]

    _Cran._                   And let heaven
    Witness how dear I hold this confirmation.

    _King._ Good man, those joyful tears show thy true heart:[851]
    The common voice, I see, is verified                             175
    Of thee, which says thus: 'Do my Lord of Canterbury
    A shrewd turn, and he is your friend for ever.'[852]
    Come, lords, we trifle time away; I long
    To have this young one made a Christian.
    As I have made ye one, lords, one remain:                        180
    So I grow stronger, you more honour gain.                 [_Exeunt._


SCENE IV. _The palace yard._[853]

         _Noise and tumult within. Enter_ Porter _and his_ Man.

    _Port._ You'll leave your noise anon, ye rascals: do you[854][855]
    take the court for Paris-garden? ye rude slaves, leave your[854][856]
    gaping.[854]

    [_Within_] 'Good master porter, I belong to the larder.'[854][857]

    _Port._ Belong to the gallows, and be hanged, ye rogue![854][858]  5
    Is this a place to roar in? Fetch me a dozen crab-tree[854][859]
    staves, and strong ones: these are but switches to 'em.[854][860]
    I'll scratch your heads: you must be seeing christenings?[854]
    do you look for ale and cakes here, you rude rascals?[854]

    _Man._ Pray, sir, be patient: 'tis as much impossible--           10
    Unless we sweep 'em from the door with cannons--
    To scatter 'em, as 'tis to make 'em sleep
    On May-day morning; which will never be:
    We may as well push against Powle's as stir 'em.[861]

    _Port._ How got they in, and be hang'd?                           15

    _Man._ Alas, I know not; how gets the tide in?
    As much as one sound cudgel of four foot--
    You see the poor remainder--could distribute,
    I made no spare, sir.

    _Port._               You did nothing, sir.

    Man. I am not Samson, nor Sir Guy, nor Colbrand,[862]             20
    To mow 'em down before me: but if I spared any[862]
    That had a head to hit, either young or old,[862]
    He or she, cuckold or cuckold-maker,[862]
    Let me ne'er hope to see a chine again;[862][863]
    And that I would not for a cow, God save her![862][864]           25

    [_Within_] 'Do you hear, master porter?'[857]

    _Port._ I shall be with you presently, good master puppy.[857]
    Keep the door close, sirrah.

    _Man._ What would you have me do?

    _Port._ What should you do, but knock 'em down by[865][866]       30
    the dozens? Is this Moorfields to muster in? or have we[866]
    some strange Indian with the great tool come to court, the[866]
    women so besiege us? Bless me, what a fry of fornication[866]
    is at door! On my Christian conscience, this one christening[866][867]
    will beget a thousand; here will be father, godfather,[866]       35
    and all together.[866]

    _Man._ The spoons will be the bigger, sir. There is a[866]
    fellow somewhat near the door, he should be a brazier by[866]
    his face, for, o' my conscience, twenty of the dog-days now[866]
    reign in's nose; all that stand about him are under the[866][868]  40
    line, they need no other penance: that fire-drake did I hit[866]
    three times on the head, and three times was his nose[866]
    discharged against me; he stands there, like a mortar-piece,[866]
    to blow us. There was a haberdasher's wife of small[866][869]
    wit near him, that railed upon me till her pinked porringer[866]  45
    fell off her head, for kindling such a combustion in the[866][870]
    state. I missed the meteor once, and hit that woman, who[866]
    cried out 'Clubs!' when I might see from far some forty[866][871]
    truncheoners draw to her succour, which were the hope o'[866][872]
    the Strand, where she was quartered. They fell on; I made[866][873]  50
    good my place: at length they came to the broomstaff to[866][874]
    me; I defied 'em still: when suddenly a file of boys behind[866][874][875]
    'em, loose shot, delivered such a shower of pebbles, that[866][875][876]
    I was fain to draw mine honour in and let 'em win the[866]
    work: the devil was amongst 'em, I think, surely.[866]            55

    _Port._ These are the youths that thunder at a play-house[866]
    and fight for bitten apples; that no audience, but[866]
    the tribulation of Tower-hill, or the limbs of Limehouse,[866][877][878]
    their dear brothers, are able to endure. I have some of[866][879]
    'em in Limbo Patrum, and there they are like to dance[866]        60
    these three days; besides the running banquet of two[866]
    beadles that is to come.[866]

                       _Enter_ LORD CHAMBERLAIN.

    _Cham._ Mercy o' me, what a multitude are here![880]
    They grow still too; from all parts they are coming,
    As if we kept a fair here. Where are these porters,[881]          65
    These lazy knaves? Ye have made a fine hand, fellows:[882]
    There's a trim rabble let in: are all these
    Your faithful friends o' the suburbs? We shall have
    Great store of room, no doubt, left for the ladies,
    When they pass back from the christening.

    _Port._                            An't please your honour,[883]  70
    We are but men; and what so many may do,[884]
    Not being torn a-pieces, we have done:[885]
    An army cannot rule 'em.

    _Cham._                  As I live,
    If the king blame me for't, I'll lay ye all
    By the heels, and suddenly; and on your heads                     75
    Clap round fines for neglect: ye 're lazy knaves;[886]
    And here ye lie baiting of bombards when
    Ye should do service. Hark! the trumpets sound;
    They're come already from the christening:[887]
    Go, break among the press, and find a way out[888]                80
    To let the troop pass fairly, or I'll find
    A Marshalsea shall hold ye play these two months.

    _Port._ Make way there for the princess.[889]

    _Man._                                   You great fellow,
    Stand close up, or I'll make your head ache.

    _Port._ You i' the camlet, get up o' the rail;[890]               85
    I'll peck you o'er the pales else.                   [_Exeunt._[891]


SCENE V. _The palace._[892]

    _Enter_ Trumpets, _sounding; then two_ Aldermen, Lord Mayor,
        Garter, CRANMER, DUKE OF NORFOLK _with his marshal's
        staff_, DUKE OF SUFFOLK, _two_ Noblemen _bearing great
        standing-bowls for the christening-gifts; then four_
        Noblemen _bearing a canopy, under which the_ DUCHESS OF
        NORFOLK, _godmother, bearing the child richly habited in
        a mantle, &c., train borne by a Lady; then follows the_
        MARCHIONESS DORSET, _the other godmother, and_ Ladies. _The
        troop pass once about the stage, and_ Garter _speaks_.

    _Gart._ Heaven, from thy endless goodness, send prosperous[893]
    life, long, and ever happy, to the high and mighty[893]
    princess of England, Elizabeth![893]

                _Flourish. Enter_ KING _and Guard_.[894]

    _Cran._ [_Kneeling_] And to your royal grace, and the
                good queen.[895][896]
    My noble partners and myself thus pray:[896]                       5
    All comfort, joy, in this most gracious lady,[897]
    Heaven ever laid up to make parents happy,[898]
    May hourly fall upon ye!

    _King._                  Thank you, good lord archbishop:[899]
    What is her name?

    _Cran._           Elizabeth.

    _King._                      Stand up, lord.

                                          [_The King kisses the child._

    With this kiss take my blessing: God protect thee![900]           10
    Into whose hand I give thy life.

    _Cran._                           Amen.

    _King._ My noble gossips, ye have been too prodigal:[901]
    I thank ye heartily; so shall this lady,
    When she has so much English.

    _Cran._                       Let me speak, sir,
    For heaven now bids me; and the words I utter                     15
    Let none think flattery, for they'll find 'em truth.
    This royal infant--heaven still move about her!--
    Though in her cradle, yet now promises
    Upon this land a thousand thousand blessings,
    Which time shall bring to ripeness: she shall be--                20
    But few now living can behold that goodness--[902]
    A pattern to all princes living with her
    And all that shall succeed: Saba was never[903]
    More covetous of wisdom and fair virtue
    Than this pure soul shall be: all princely graces,[904]           25
    That mould up such a mighty piece as this is,[905]
    With all the virtues that attend the good,
    Shall still be doubled on her: truth shall nurse her,
    Holy and heavenly thoughts still counsel her:
    She shall be loved and fear'd: her own shall bless her;           30
    Her foes shake like a field of beaten corn,[906]
    And hang their heads with sorrow. Good grows with her:[907]
    In her days every man shall eat in safety,
    Under his own vine, what he plants, and sing
    The merry songs of peace to all his neighbours:                   35
    God shall be truly known; and those about her
    From her shall read the perfect ways of honour,[908][909]
    And by those claim their greatness, not by blood.[909]
    Nor shall this peace sleep with her; but, as when[910]
    The bird of wonder dies, the maiden phœnix,[910]                  40
    Her ashes new create another heir[910]
    As great in admiration as herself,[910]
    So shall she leave her blessedness to one--[910]
    When heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness--[910]
    Who from the sacred ashes of her honour[910]                      45
    Shall star-like rise, as great in fame as she was,[910]
    And so stand fix'd. Peace, plenty, love, truth, terror,[910]
    That were the servants to this chosen infant,[910]
    Shall then be his and like a vine grow to him:[910]
    Wherever the bright sun of heaven shall shine,[910]               50
    His honour and the greatness of his name[910]
    Shall be, and make new nations: he shall flourish,[910]
    And, like a mountain cedar, reach his branches[910]
    To all the plains about him. Our children's children[910][911]
    Shall see this, and bless heaven.[910]

    _King._                           Thou speakest wonders.          55

    _Cran._ She shall be, to the happiness of England,[912]
    An aged princess; many days shall see her,[912]
    And yet no day without a deed to crown it.[912]
    Would I had known no more! but she must die;[912]
    She must; the saints must have her; yet a virgin,[912][913]       60
    A most unspotted lily shall she pass[912][914]
    To the ground, and all the world shall mourn her.[912][915]

    _King._ O lord archbishop,
    Thou hast made me now a man! never, before
    This happy child, did I get any thing.                            65
    This oracle of comfort has so pleased me,
    That when I am in heaven I shall desire
    To see what this child does, and praise my Maker.
    I thank ye all. To you, my good lord mayor,
    And your good brethren, I am much beholding;[916]                 70
    I have received much honour by your presence,
    And ye shall find me thankful. Lead the way, lords:
    Ye must all see the queen, and she must thank ye;
    She will be sick else. This day, no man think
    Has business at his house; for all shall stay:[917]               75
    This little one shall make it holiday.                    [_Exeunt._

THE EPILOGUE.


      'Tis ten to one this play can never please
    All that are here: some come to take their ease,[918]
    And sleep an act or two; but those, we fear,[919]
    We have frighted with our trumpets; so, 'tis clear,[920]
    They'll say 'tis naught: others, to hear the city[921]             5
    Abused extremely, and to cry 'That's witty!'
    Which we have not done neither; that, I fear,
    All the expected good we're like to hear[922]
    For this play at this time, is only in[923]
    The merciful construction of good women;[923]                     10
    For such a one we show'd 'em: if they smile,
    And say 'twill do, I know, within a while
    All the best men are ours; for 'tis ill hap,
    If they hold when their ladies bid 'em clap.

NOTES.


NOTE I.

I. 1. 167. Mr Collier says: "In the three earlier folios the word
is spelt 'wrenching,' which the printer of the fourth folio, not
understanding, altered to 'drenching.'" In the three copies of the
fourth folio now before us the word is 'wrenching.'


NOTE II.

I. 2. Capell, followed by Malone, made many gratuitous alterations in
the stage-directions of the Folios, which we have not thought it worth
while always to record.


NOTE III.

II. 3. 7-9. Pope's reading is as follows:

    'Still growing in a majesty and pomp,
    The which to leave, a thousand-fold more bitter
    Than sweet at first t'acquire.'

Theobald, followed by Hanmer, has:

    'Still growing to a majesty and pomp,
    The which to leave's a thousand-fold more bitter
    Than sweet at first t'acquire.'

Capell reads, following the arrangement of the Folios:

    'Still growing in a majesty and pomp,--the which
    To leave, 's a thousand fold more bitter, than
    'Tis sweet at first to acquire.'

We are in doubt here as to which is the reading of Mr Collier's MS.
Corrector, for in his edition of Coleridge's Lectures he gives it,

    'To leave's a thousand times more bitter, than
    Sweet, &c.'

while in the second edition of his Shakespeare he quotes it as follows:

    'To leave's a thousand-fold more better, than
    'Tis sweet, &c.'


NOTE IV.

II. 3. 103. Mr Collier says, "If the blood of Anne Bullen had saluted
or welcomed the news,--'If my blood salute this a jot--' there would
have been no difficulty." It is not clear whether Mr Collier intends
this as a conjectural emendation or not.


NOTE V.

II. 3. The stage direction which we have given from the Folios has been
variously altered. The only important change which Capell introduces
is in making the Archbishop of Canterbury follow the Bishops. The
alteration 'between' for 'below' appeared in Reed's edition of 1803,
and has been followed by some modern editors.


NOTE VI.

II. 4. 75. This line appears to have been accidentally omitted by the
printer of the edition by Johnson, who, without taking the trouble
to refer even to Warburton's text, conjectured that the passage was
corrupt and proposed to read:

                          'Nay, before.--
    Induc'd by potent circumstances, that
    You are my enemy, I make my challenge.
    You shall not be my judge.'


NOTE VII.

II. 4. 182. Mr Collier, in his 2nd edition, says, "We are quite
satisfied that Theobald was right in reading 'The bottom of my
conscience.'" Theobald does not adopt the conjecture in his text. His
note is as follows: "Tho this reading be sense, and therefore I have
not ventur'd to displace it; yet, I verily believe, the poet wrote;
'The bottom of my conscience,--' My reason is this. Shakespeare in all
his historical plays was a most diligent observer of Hollingshead's
Chronicle; and had him always in eye, wherever he thought fit to borrow
any matter from him. Now Hollingshead, in the speech which he has
given to King Henry upon this subject, makes him deliver himself thus.
'Which words, once conceived within the secret bottom of my conscience,
ingendred such a scrupulous doubt, that my conscience was incontinently
accombred, vex'd, and disquieted.'" Theobald appears to have forgotten
that the emendation was suggested to him by Dr Thirlby. See Nichols'
_Illustrations_, II. p. 461.


NOTE VIII.

III. 2. 192. The first and second folios, which in so doubtful a case
we have followed, read:

    'that am, have, and will be (Though ... horrid) yet my duty, &c.'

The third and fourth extend the parenthesis so as to include line 198,
'(Though ... break).'

Rowe reads: 'that am I, have been, and will be: Though ... horrid; yet,
my duty, &c.'

Pope: 'that am I, have been, will be:' pointing the rest with Rowe.

Capell, reading as the folios, puts a full stop at 'be,' line 192, and
a semicolon at 'horrid,' line 196.

Mason proposes to omit the words 'that am, have, and will be,' because
he can find no meaning in them.

Malone supposes that a line following 192 has been lost.

Seymour proposes to read:

            'that I am, have been, and shall be
        ....................................
    And throw it from their soul (most firm and loyal)
    Though perils &c.'

Jackson conjectures: 'that aim, has and will be, Though, &c.' or, 'that
aim has, and will be To you, though ... duty, And throw, &c.'

Mr Knight conjectures: 'that aim I have and will, Though, &c.,' 'will'
being here a noun.

Mr Collier adopts this reading, but takes 'will' to be a verb, for
'will have.'

Mr Singer reads: 'that I am true, and will be, Though, &c.' by which,
he says, all is made 'congruous and clear.'

Mitford would read: 'that am, and will be yours. Though, &c.'

Dr Badham suggests: 'that am your slave and will be. Though, &c.'

Mr Staunton conjectures: 'to that I am slave and will be, Though, &c.'

Sidney Walker says: "If there be no other corruption, the period after
'be' ought to be replaced by a comma: otherwise the words appear
unintelligible. Even so, however, this will be a most harsh instance of
ἀνακολουθία. But I rather think that a line is lost, somewhat to the
following effect:

              'that I am, have, and will be,
    [In heart and act, tied to your service; yea,]
    Though all the world should, &c.'"

Mr Grant White adopts Mr Singer's reading, nearly: 'that am true and
will be, &c.'

Mr Nichols proposes to transfer 'yours' from line 199 to follow 'will
be:'

        'that am, have, and will be yours
    .................................
             ... and stand unshaken.'

Mr Keightley prints, 'that am, have and will be ... Though &c.,'
indicating that the sense is interrupted.


NOTE IX.

III. 2. 208, 209. The misreading 'may' for 'have,' which is so familiar
to us in this often-quoted passage, was not corrected by Pope or any
subsequent editor till Capell.


NOTE X.

V. 3. Mr Grant White suggests that a new scene should begin here,
"although the stage direction in the folio is only 'A Councell Table
brought in with Chayres and Stooles, and placed under the State,' &c.
But this is plainly the mere result of the absence of scenery of any
kind on Shakespeare's stage, and the audience were to imagine that
the scene changed from the lobby before the Council Chamber to that
apartment itself." We have adopted his suggestion, thinking that the
obvious propriety of changing the scene outweighs any inconvenience
which might result for purposes of reference. Hanmer, Warburton,
and Johnson all follow Pope in calling this Scene V. Theobald also
supposes a new scene to begin here, although in his edition the scenes
are not numbered. Capell, by his stage direction, indicated that the
scene presented the Council-chamber and the lobby both at once to the
eyes of the spectators.


NOTE XI.

V. 4. 30-61. It is scarcely worth while to record how Capell cut up
these thirty lines of prose into verse. No editor has followed him.
Mr Sidney Walker however has made a similar attempt, but is forced
to admit that in some changes of reading he has 'ventured beyond the
lawful limits of an emendator.' With the same license, it would be easy
to convert an Act of Parliament or a leading article into verse.

Mr Walker also has followed Capell, or perhaps has hit independently
on the same arrangement, as regards the first part of the scene. The
intervening lines from 10 to 30 are printed as verse in the folio. In
these he proposes some trifling changes of arrangement.


NOTE XII.

V. 5. 1-4. Pope, with more than usual audacity, makes the lines run
smoothly by thus changing them:

    'Heav'n, from thy endless goodness, send long life,
    And ever happy, to the high and mighty
    Princess of England, fair Elizabeth.'

Theobald, Hanmer, Warburton, and Johnson adopt Pope's reading without
remark.


NOTE XIII.

V. 5. 32. Mr Collier mentions that the second Folio has 'Come' in this
line, a misprint rectified by his 'old annotator.' In three copies
which we have consulted it is distinctly 'Corne.'


NOTE XIV.

V. 5. 39-55, 56-62. Theobald was the first to suggest that lines 39
to 55 'Nor shall this peace ... bless heaven,' and lines 56 to 62,
'She shall be ... mourn her,' were an interpolation. Cranmer's speech
originally, as he supposed, ended at 'not by blood.' Then the King
replied:

    'Thou speakest wonders. O lord Archbishop, &c.'

THE PROLOGUE.[925]


    In Troy there lies the scene. From isles of Greece
    The princes orgulous, their high blood chafed,[926]
    Have to the port of Athens sent their ships,
    Fraught with the ministers and instruments
    Of cruel war: sixty and nine, that wore                            5
    Their crownets regal, from the Athenian bay
    Put forth toward Phrygia, and their vow is made
    To ransack Troy, within whose strong immures[927]
    The ravish'd Helen, Menelaus' queen,
    With wanton Paris sleeps; and that's the quarrel.                 10
    To Tenedos they come;
    And the deep-drawing barks do there disgorge[928]
    Their warlike fraughtage: now on Dardan plains
    The fresh and yet unbruised Greeks do pitch
    Their brave pavilions: Priam's six-gated city,[929]               15
    Dardan, and Timbria, Helias, Chetas, Troien,[930]
    And Antenorides, with massy staples,[931]
    And corresponsive and fulfilling bolts,[932]
    Sperr up the sons of Troy.[933]
    Now expectation, tickling skittish spirits,                       20
    On one and other side, Trojan and Greek,
    Sets all on hazard: and hither am I come
    A prologue arm'd, but not in confidence
    Of author's pen or actor's voice, but suited
    In like conditions as our argument,                               25
    To tell you, fair beholders, that our play
    Leaps o'er the vaunt and firstlings of those broils,
    Beginning in the middle; starting thence away[934]
    To what may be digested in a play.
    Like, or find fault; do as your pleasures are:                    30
    Now good or bad, 'tis but the chance of war.[935]

ACT I.


SCENE I. _Troy. Before Priam's palace._

                  _Enter_ PANDARUS _and_ TROILUS.[936]

    _Tro._ Call here my varlet; I'll unarm again:
    Why should I war without the walls of Troy,
    That find such cruel battle here within?
    Each Trojan that is master of his heart,[937]
    Let him to field; Troilus, alas, hath none!                        5

    _Pan._ Will this gear ne'er be mended?

    _Tro._ The Greeks are strong and skilful to their strength,
    Fierce to their skill and to their fierceness valiant,
    But I am weaker than a woman's tear,
    Tamer than sleep, fonder than ignorance,[938]                     10
    Less valiant than the virgin in the night,
    And skilless as unpractised infancy.

    _Pan._ Well, I have told you enough of this: for my part,
    I 'll not meddle nor make no farther. He that will have a[939]
    cake out of the wheat must needs tarry the grinding.[940]         15

    _Tro._ Have I not tarried?

    _Pan._ Ay, the grinding; but you must tarry the bolting.[941]

    _Tro._ Have I not tarried?

    _Pan._ Ay, the bolting; but you must tarry the leavening.

    _Tro._ Still have I tarried.                                      20

    _Pan._ Ay, to the leavening; but here's yet in the word[942]
    'hereafter,' the kneading, the making of the cake, the heating
    of the oven, and the baking; nay, you must stay the[943]
    cooling too, or you may chance to burn your lips.[944]

    _Tro._ Patience herself, what goddess e'er she be,                25
    Doth lesser blench at sufferance than I do.[945]
    At Priam's royal table do I sit;[946]
    And when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts,--[947][948]
    So, traitor!--'When she comes!'--When is she thence?[948]

    _Pan._ Well, she looked yesternight fairer than ever I[949]       30
    saw her look, or any woman else.[949]

    _Tro._ I was about to tell thee:--when my heart,[950]
    As wedged with a sigh, would rive in twain,
    Lest Hector or my father should perceive me,
    I have, as when the sun doth light a storm,[951]                  35
    Buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile:
    But sorrow, that is couch'd in seeming gladness,
    Is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness.

    _Pan._ An her hair were not somewhat darker than[952]
    Helen's--well, go to--there were no more comparison between       40
    the women: but, for my part, she is my kinswoman;[953]
    I would not, as they term it, praise her: but I would somebody[954]
    had heard her talk yesterday, as I did. I will not
    dispraise your sister Cassandra's wit, but--

    _Tro._ O Pandarus! I tell thee, Pandarus,--                       45
    When I do tell thee, there my hopes lie drown'd,
    Reply not in how many fathoms deep[955]
    They lie indrench'd. I tell thee, I am mad[956][957]
    In Cressid's love: thou answer'st 'she is fair;'[957]
    Pour'st in the open ulcer of my heart[958][959]                   50
    Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice,[959]
    Handlest in thy discourse, O, that her hand,[959][960][961]
    In whose comparison all whites are ink[961]
    Writing their own reproach, to whose soft seizure[961]
    The cygnet's down is harsh and spirit of sense[961][962]          55
    Hard as the palm of ploughman: this thou tell'st me,[961]
    As true thou tell'st me, when I say I love her;[963]
    But, saying thus, instead of oil and balm,
    Thou lay'st in every gash that love hath given me
    The knife that made it.                                           60

    _Pan._ I speak no more than truth.

    _Tro._ Thou dost not speak so much.

    _Pan._ Faith, I'll not meddle in't. Let her be as she is:[964]
    if she be fair, 'tis the better for her; an she be not, she has[965]
    the mends in her own hands.                                       65

    _Tro._ Good Pandarus, how now, Pandarus![966]

    _Pan._ I have had my labour for my travail; ill-thought
    on of her, and ill-thought on of you: gone between and between,[967]
    but small thanks for my labour.

    _Tro._ What, art thou angry, Pandarus? what, with me?             70

    _Pan._ Because she's kin to me, therefore she's not so[968]
    fair as Helen: an she were not kin to me, she would be as[965][969]
    fair on Friday as Helen is on Sunday. But what care I?[970]
    I care not an she were a black-a-moor; 'tis all one to me.[965]

    _Tro._ Say I she is not fair?                                     75

    _Pan._ I do not care whether you do or no. She's a
    fool to stay behind her father; let her to the Greeks; and
    so I'll tell her the next time I see her: for my part, I'll
    meddle nor make no more i' the matter.[971]

    _Tro._ Pandarus,--                                                80

    _Pan._ Not I.

    _Tro._ Sweet Pandarus,--

    _Pan._ Pray you, speak no more to me: I will leave all
    as I found it, and there an end.            [_Exit. An alarum._[972]

    _Tro._ Peace, you ungracious clamours! peace, rude sounds!        85
    Fools on both sides! Helen must needs be fair,
    When with your blood you daily paint her thus.
    I cannot fight upon this argument;
    It is too starved a subject for my sword.
    But Pandarus--O gods, how do you plague me!                       90
    I cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar;[973]
    And he's as tetchy to be woo'd to woo[974]
    As she is stubborn-chaste against all suit.[975]
    Tell me, Apollo, for thy Daphne's love,
    What Cressid is, what Pandar, and what we?                        95
    Her bed is India; there she lies, a pearl:
    Between our Ilium and where she resides,[976]
    Let it be call'd the wild and wandering flood,[977]
    Ourself the merchant, and this sailing Pandar
    Our doubtful hope, our convoy and our bark.                      100

                         _Alarum. Enter_ ÆNEAS.

    _Æne._ How now, Prince Troilus! wherefore not afield?[978]

    _Tro._ Because not there: this woman's answer sorts,
    For womanish it is to be from thence.
    What news, Æneas, from the field to-day?

    _Æne._ That Paris is returned home, and hurt.                    105

    _Tro._ By whom, Æneas?

    _Æne._                 Troilus, by Menelaus.

    _Tro._ Let Paris bleed: 'tis but a scar to scorn;
    Paris is gored with Menelaus' horn.                       [_Alarum._

    _Æne._ Hark, what good sport is out of town to-day!

    _Tro._ Better at home, if 'would I might' were 'may.'            110
    But to the sport abroad: are you bound thither?

    _Æne._ In all swift haste.

    _Tro._                     Come, go we then together.     [_Exeunt._


SCENE II. _The same. A street._

            _Enter_ CRESSIDA _and_ ALEXANDER _her man_.[979]

    _Cres._ Who were those went by?

    _Alex._                         Queen Hecuba and Helen[980]

    _Cres._ And whither go they?

    _Alex._                      Up to the eastern tower.
    Whose height commands as subject all the vale,
    To see the battle. Hector, whose patience[981]
    Is as a virtue fix'd, to-day was moved:[982]                       5
    He chid Andromache and struck his armourer;[983]
    And, like as there were husbandry in war,
    Before the sun rose he was harness'd light,[984]
    And to the field goes he; where every flower
    Did, as a prophet, weep what it foresaw                           10
    In Hector's wrath.

    _Cres._            What was his cause of anger?

    Alex. The noise goes, this: there is among the Greeks[985]
    A lord of Trojan blood, nephew to Hector;
    They call him Ajax.

    _Cres._             Good; and what of him?

    _Alex._ They say he is a very man per se,[986][987]               15
    And stands alone.[986]

    _Cres._ So do all men, unless they are drunk, sick, or[988]
    have no legs.

    _Alex._ This man, lady, hath robbed many beasts of
    their particular additions; he is as valiant as the lion,         20
    churlish as the bear, slow as the elephant: a man into whom
    nature hath so crowded humours that his valour is crushed[989]
    into folly, his folly sauced with discretion: there is no man[989][990]
    hath a virtue that he hath not a glimpse of, nor any man
    an attaint but he carries some stain of it: he is melancholy      25
    without cause and merry against the hair: he hath the
    joints of every thing; but every thing so out of joint that
    he is a gouty Briareus, many hands and no use, or purblind[991]
    Argus, all eyes and no sight.

    _Cres._ But how should this man, that makes me smile,             30
    make Hector angry?

    _Alex._ They say he yesterday coped Hector in the battle
    and struck him down, the disdain and shame whereof[992]
    hath ever since kept Hector fasting and waking.

                         _Enter_ PANDARUS.[993]

    _Cres._ Who comes here?[994]                                      35

    _Alex._ Madam, your uncle Pandarus.

    _Cres._ Hector's a gallant man.

    _Alex._ As may be in the world, lady.

    _Pan._ What's that? what's that?

    _Cres._ Good morrow, uncle Pandarus.                              40

    _Pan._ Good morrow, cousin Cressid: what do you talk
    of? Good morrow, Alexander. How do you, cousin?[995]
    When were you at Ilium?[996]

    _Cres._ This morning, uncle.

    _Pan._ What were you talking of when I came? Was                  45
    Hector armed and gone ere you came to Ilium? Helen[997]
    was not up, was she?

    _Cres._ Hector was gone; but Helen was not up.[998]

    _Pan._ E'en so: Hector was stirring early.

    _Cres._ That were we talking of, and of his anger.                50

    _Pan._ Was he angry?

    _Cres._ So he says here.

    _Pan._ True, he was so; I know the cause too; he'll lay
    about him to-day, I can tell them that: and there's Troilus
    will not come far behind him; let them take heed of Troilus,      55
    I can tell them that too.

    _Cres._ What, is he angry too?

    _Pan._ Who, Troilus? Troilus is the better man of the[999]
    two.

    _Cres._ O Jupiter! there's no comparison.                         60

    _Pan._ What, not between Troilus and Hector? Do
    you know a man if you see him?

    _Cres._ Ay, if I ever saw him before and knew him.

    _Pan._ Well, I say Troilus is Troilus.

    _Cres._ Then you say as I say; for, I am sure, he is not[1000]    65
    Hector.[1000]

    _Pan._ No, nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees.[1001]

    _Cres._ 'Tis just to each of them; he is himself.[1002]

    _Pan._ Himself! Alas, poor Troilus! I would he were.[1003]

    _Cres._ So he is.                                                 70

    _Pan._ Condition, I had gone barefoot to India.[1004]

    _Cres._ He is not Hector.

    _Pan._ Himself! no, he's not himself: would a' were[1005]
    himself! Well, the gods are above; time must friend or
    end: well, Troilus, well, I would my heart were in her            75
    body! No, Hector is not a better man than Troilus.

    _Cres._ Excuse me.

    _Pan._ He is elder.

    _Cres._ Pardon me, pardon me.

    Pan. Th' other's not come to't; you shall tell me another[1006]   80
    tale, when th' other's come to't. Hector shall not have[1006]
    his wit this year.[1007]

    _Cres._ He shall not need it, if he have his own.

    _Pan._ Nor his qualities.

    _Cres._ No matter.                                                85

    _Pan._ Nor his beauty.

    _Cres._ 'Twould not become him; his own's better.

    _Pan._ You have no judgement, niece: Helen herself
    swore th' other day, that Troilus, for a brown favour--for
    so 'tis, I must confess,--not brown neither,--                    90

    _Cres._ No, but brown.[1008]

    _Pan._ Faith, to say truth, brown and not brown.

    _Cres._ To say the truth, true and not true.

    _Pan._ She praised his complexion above Paris.[1009]

    _Cres._ Why, Paris hath colour enough.                            95

    _Pan._ So he has.

    _Cres._ Then Troilus should have too much: if she praised[1010]
    him above, his complexion is higher than his; he having[1011]
    colour enough, and the other higher, is too flaming a praise[1012]
    for a good complexion. I had as lief Helen's golden tongue[1013]  100
    had commended Troilus for a copper nose.

    _Pan._ I swear to you, I think Helen loves him better[1014]
    than Paris.[1014]

    _Cres._ Then she's a merry Greek indeed.

    _Pan._ Nay, I am sure she does. She came to him th'              105
    other day into the compassed window,--and, you know, he
    has not past three or four hairs on his chin,--

    _Cres._ Indeed, a tapster's arithmetic may soon bring his
    particulars therein to a total.

    _Pan._ Why, he is very young: and yet will he, within            110
    three pound, lift as much as his brother Hector.[1015]

    _Cres._ Is he so young a man and so old a lifter?[1016]

    _Pan._ But, to prove to you that Helen loves him: she
    came and puts me her white hand to his cloven chin--

    _Cres._ Juno have mercy! how came it cloven?                     115

    _Pan._ Why, you know, 'tis dimpled: I think his smiling
    becomes him better than any man in all Phrygia.

    _Cres._ O, he smiles valiantly.[1017]

    _Pan._ Does he not?

    _Cres._ O yes, an 'twere a cloud in autumn.[1018]                120

    _Pan._ Why, go to, then: but to prove to you that Helen
    loves Troilus,--

    _Cres._ Troilus will stand to the proof, if you'll prove[1019][1020]
    it so.[1019]

    _Pan._ Troilus! why, he esteems her no more than I esteem        125
    an addle egg.

    _Cres._ If you love an addle egg as well as you love an
    idle head, you would eat chickens i'the shell.

    _Pan._ I cannot choose but laugh, to think how she tickled
    his chin; indeed, she has a marvellous white hand, I must[1021]  130
    needs confess,--

    _Cres._ Without the rack.

    _Pan._ And she takes upon her to spy a white hair on
    his chin.

    _Cres._ Alas, poor chin! many a wart is richer.                  135

    _Pan._ But there was such laughing! Queen Hecuba
    laughed, that her eyes ran o'er.[1022]

    _Cres._ With mill-stones.

    _Pan._ And Cassandra laughed.

    _Cres._ But there was more temperate fire under the pot[1023]    140
    of her eyes: did her eyes run o'er too?

    _Pan._ And Hector laughed.

    _Cres._ At what was all this laughing?

    _Pan._ Marry, at the white hair that Helen spied on
    Troilus' chin.[1024]                                             145

    _Cres._ An't had been a green hair, I should have laughed[1025]
    too.

    _Pan._ They laughed not so much at the hair as at his
    pretty answer.

    _Cres._ What was his answer?                                     150

    _Pan._ Quoth she, 'Here's but two and fifty hairs on[1026]
    your chin, and one of them is white.'

    _Cres._ This is her question.

    _Pan._ That's true; make no question of that. 'Two and[1027]
    fifty hairs,' quoth he, 'and one white: that white hair is my[1028]  155
    father, and all the rest are his sons.' 'Jupiter!' quoth she,
    'which of these hairs is Paris my husband?' 'The forked
    one,' quoth he, 'pluck't out, and give it him.' But there[1029]
    was such laughing! and Helen so blushed, and Paris so
    chafed, and all the rest so laughed, that it passed.             160

    _Cres._ So let it now; for it has been a great while going by.[1030]

    _Pan._ Well, cousin, I told you a thing yesterday; think[1031]
    on't.[1031]

    _Cres._ So I do.[1032]

    _Pan._ I'll be sworn 'tis true; he will weep you, an[165, 167]   165
    'twere a man born in April.

    _Cres._ And I'll spring up in his tears, an 'twere a nettle[1033]
    against May.                             [_A retreat sounded._[1034]

    _Pan._ Hark! they are coming from the field: shall we
    stand up here, and see them as they pass toward Ilium?[1035]     170
    good niece, do, sweet niece Cressida.

    _Cres._ At your pleasure.

    _Pan._ Here, here, here's an excellent place; here we
    may see most bravely: I'll tell you them all by their names
    as they pass by; but mark Troilus above the rest.                175

                         ÆNEAS _passes_.[1036]

    _Cres._ Speak not so loud.

    _Pan._ That's Æneas: is not that a brave man? he's one
    of the flowers of Troy, I can tell you: but mark Troilus;[1037]
    you shall see anon.

    _Cres._ Who's that?[1038]                                        180

                           ANTENOR _passes_.

    _Pan._ That's Antenor: he has a shrewd wit, I can tell[1039]
    you; and he's a man good enough: he's one o' the soundest[1040]
    judgements in Troy, whosoever, and a proper man of person.[1041]
    When comes Troilus? I'll show you Troilus anon:
    if he see me, you shall see him nod at me.[1042]                 185

    _Cres._ Will he give you the nod?

    _Pan._ You shall see.

    _Cres._ If he do, the rich shall have more.[1043]

                            HECTOR _passes_.

    _Pan._ That's Hector, that, that, look you, that; there's
    a fellow! Go thy way, Hector! There's a brave man,               190
    niece. O brave Hector! Look how he looks! there's a
    countenance! is't not a brave man?

    _Cres._ O, a brave man![1044]

    _Pan._ Is a' not? it does a man's heart good. Look you[1045]
    what hacks are on his helmet! look you yonder, do you            195
    see? look you there: there's no jesting; there's laying on,[1046]
    take't off who will, as they say: there be hacks![1047]

    _Cres._ Be those with swords?

    _Pan._ Swords! any thing, he cares not; an the devil[1048]
    come to him, it's all one: by God's lid, it does one's heart     200
    good. Yonder comes Paris, yonder comes Paris.

                         PARIS _passes_.[1049]

    Look ye yonder, niece; is't not a gallant man too, is't not?
    Why, this is brave now. Who said he came hurt home to-day?[1050]
    he's not hurt: why, this will do Helen's heart good
    now, ha! Would I could see Troilus now! you shall see[1051]      205
    Troilus anon.

    _Cres._ Who's that?

                           HELENUS _passes_.

    _Pan._ That's Helenus: I marvel where Troilus is.
    That's Helenus. I think he went not forth to-day. That's
    Helenus.                                                         210

    _Cres._ Can Helenus fight, uncle?

    _Pan._ Helenus! no; yes, he'll fight indifferent well. I[1052]
    marvel where Troilus is. Hark! do you not hear the[1053]
    people cry 'Troilus'? Helenus is a priest.

    _Cres._ What sneaking fellow comes yonder?                       215

                           TROILUS _passes_.

    _Pan._ Where? yonder? that's Deiphobus. 'Tis Troilus!
    there's a man, niece! Hem! Brave Troilus! the prince of
    chivalry!

    _Cres._ Peace, for shame, peace!

    _Pan._ Mark him; note him. O brave Troilus! Look[1054]           220
    well upon him, niece; look you how his sword is bloodied,
    and his helm more hacked than Hector's; and how he looks,
    and how he goes! O admirable youth! he never saw[1055]
    three-and-twenty. Go thy way, Troilus, go thy way! Had I a
    sister were a grace, or a daughter a goddess, he should take[1056]  225
    his choice. O admirable man! Paris? Paris is dirt to him;[1057]
    and, I warrant, Helen, to change, would give an eye to boot.

                     Common Soldiers _pass_.[1058]

    _Cres._ Here come more.[1059]

    _Pan._ Asses, fools, dolts! chaff and bran, chaff and
    bran! porridge after meat! I could live and die i'the eyes       230
    of Troilus. Ne'er look, ne'er look; the eagles are gone:
    crows and daws, crows and daws! I had rather be such a
    man as Troilus than Agamemnon and all Greece.

    _Cres._ There is among the Greeks Achilles, a better[1060]
    man than Troilus.                                                235

    _Pan._ Achilles! a drayman, a porter, a very camel.

    _Cres._ Well, well.

    _Pan._ Well, well! Why, have you any discretion?
    have you any eyes? do you know what a man is? Is not
    birth, beauty, good shape, discourse, manhood, learning,         240
    gentleness, virtue, youth, liberality, and such like, the spice[1061]
    and salt that season a man?[1062]

    _Cres._ Ay, a minced man: and then to be baked with
    no date in the pie, for then the man's date is out.[1063]

    _Pan._ You are such a woman! one knows not at what[1064]         245
    ward you lie.

    _Cres._ Upon my back, to defend my belly; upon my wit,
    to defend my wiles; upon my secrecy, to defend mine honesty;[1065]
    my mask, to defend my beauty; and you, to defend all[1066]
    these: and at all these wards I lie, at a thousand watches.[1067]  250

    _Pan._ Say one of your watches.

    _Cres._ Nay, I'll watch you for that; and that's one of the
    chiefest of them too: if I cannot ward what I would not have[1068]
    hit, I can watch you for telling how I took the blow; unless
    it swell past hiding, and then it's past watching.[1069]         255

    _Pan._ You are such another!

                      _Enter_ Troilus's Boy.[1070]

    _Boy._ Sir, my lord would instantly speak with you.

    _Pan._ Where?

    _Boy._ At your own house; there he unarms him.[1071]

    _Pan._ Good boy, tell him I come. [_Exit Boy._] I doubt[1072]    260
    he be hurt. Fare ye well, good niece.

    _Cres._ Adieu, uncle.

    _Pan._ I will be with you, niece, by and by.[1073]

    _Cres._ To bring, uncle?[1074]

    _Pan._ Ay, a token from Troilus.                                 265

    _Cres._ By the same token, you are a bawd.

                                                 [_Exit Pandarus._[1075]

    Words, vows, gifts, tears, and love's full sacrifice,[1076]
    He offers in another's enterprise:
    But more in Troilus thousand fold I see
    Than in the glass of Pandar's praise may be;                     270
    Yet hold I off. Women are angels, wooing:
    Things won are done; joy's soul lies in the doing:[1077]
    That she beloved knows nought that knows not this:[1078]
    Men prize the thing ungain'd more than it is:
    That she was never yet that ever knew                            275
    Love got so sweet as when desire did sue:[1079]
    Therefore this maxim out of love I teach:[1080]
    Achievement is command; ungain'd, beseech.[1080][1081]
    Then though my heart's content firm love doth bear,[1082]
    Nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear.   [_Exeunt._[1083]  280


SCENE III. _The Grecian camp. Before Agamemnon's tent._

        _Sennet._ _Enter_ AGAMEMNON, NESTOR, ULYSSES, MENELAUS,
                          _with others_.[1084]

    _Agam._ Princes,[1085]
    What grief hath set the jaundice on your cheeks?[1086]
    The ample proposition that hope makes[1087]
    In all designs begun on earth below
    Fails in the promised largeness: checks and disasters              5
    Grow in the veins of actions highest rear'd,
    As knots, by the conflux of meeting sap,
    Infect the sound pine and divert his grain[1088]
    Tortive and errant from his course of growth.
    Nor, princes, is it matter new to us                              10
    That we come short of our suppose so far
    That after seven years' siege yet Troy walls stand;
    Sith every action that hath gone before,[1089]
    Whereof we have record, trial did draw
    Bias and thwart, not answering the aim                            15
    And that unbodied figure of the thought
    That gave't surmised shape. Why then, you princes,
    Do you with checks abash'd behold our works,[1090]
    And call them shames? which are indeed nought else[1091]
    But the protractive trials of great Jove                          20
    To find persistive constancy in men:
    The fineness of which metal is not found
    In fortune's love; for then the bold and coward,
    The wise and fool, the artist and unread,
    The hard and soft, seem all affined and kin:                      25
    But in the wind and tempest of her frown,
    Distinction with a broad and powerful fan[1092]
    Puffing at all winnows the light away,
    And what hath mass or matter, by itself[1093]
    Lies rich in virtue and unmingled.                                30

    _Nest._ With due observance of thy godlike seat,[1094]
    Great Agamemnon, Nestor shall apply[1095]
    Thy latest words. In the reproof of chance[1096]
    Lies the true proof of men: the sea being smooth,
    How many shallow bauble boats dare sail                           35
    Upon her patient breast, making their way[1097]
    With those of nobler bulk![1098]
    But let the ruffian Boreas once enrage
    The gentle Thetis, and anon behold
    The strong-ribb'd bark through liquid mountains cut,[1099]        40
    Bounding between the two moist elements,
    Like Perseus' horse: where's then the saucy boat,
    Whose weak untimber'd sides but even now
    Co-rivall'd greatness? either to harbour fled,
    Or made a toast for Neptune. Even so[1100]                        45
    Doth valour's show and valour's worth divide
    In storms of fortune: for in her ray and brightness[1101]
    The herd hath more annoyance by the breese[1102]
    Than by the tiger; but when the splitting wind[1103]
    Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks,[1103]                   50
    And flies fled under shade, why then the thing of courage[1104]
    As roused with rage with rage doth sympathize,
    And with an accent tuned in selfsame key[1105]
    Retorts to chiding fortune.[1106]

    _Ulyss._                    Agamemnon,
    Thou great commander, nerve and bone of Greece,[1107]             55
    Heart of our numbers, soul and only spirit,[1108]
    In whom the tempers and the minds of all
    Should be shut up, hear what Ulysses speaks.
    Besides the applause and approbation
    The which, [_To Agamemnon_] most mighty for thy place
        and sway,[1109]  60
    [_To Nestor_] And thou most reverend for thy stretch'd-out life,[1110]
    I give to both your speeches, which were such
    As Agamemnon and the hand of Greece[1111]
    Should hold up high in brass, and such again
    As venerable Nestor, hatch'd in silver,[1112]                     65
    Should with a bond of air, strong as the axletree[1112]
    On which heaven rides, knit all the Greekish ears[1113]
    To his experienced tongue, yet let it please both,[1114]
    Thou great, and wise, to hear Ulysses speak.[1115]

    _Agam._ Speak, Prince of Ithaca; and be't of less expect[1116][1117]  70
    That matter needless, of importless burthen,[1116]
    Divide thy lips, than we are confident,[1116][1118]
    When rank Thersites opes his mastic jaws,[1116][1119]
    We shall hear music, wit and oracle.[1116]

    _Ulyss._ Troy, yet upon his basis, had been down,[1116][1120]     75
    And the great Hector's sword had lack'd a master,
    But for these instances.[1121]
    The specialty of rule hath been neglected:
    And, look, how many Grecian tents do stand[1122]
    Hollow upon this plain, so many hollow factions.[1122][1123]      80
    When that the general is not like the hive[1124]
    To whom the foragers shall all repair,[1125]
    What honey is expected? Degree being vizarded,
    The unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask.[1126]
    The heavens themselves, the planets and this centre,              85
    Observe degree, priority and place,
    Insisture, course, proportion, season, form,[1127]
    Office and custom, in all line of order:
    And therefore is the glorious planet Sol
    In noble eminence enthroned and sphered                           90
    Amidst the other; whose medicinable eye[1128]
    Corrects the ill aspects of planets evil,[1129]
    And posts like the commandment of a king,
    Sans check to good and bad: but when the planets
    In evil mixture to disorder wander,                               95
    What plagues and what portents, what mutiny,
    What raging of the sea, shaking of earth,
    Commotion in the winds, frights, changes, horrors,
    Divert and crack, rend and deracinate
    The unity and married calm of states[1130]                       100
    Quite from their fixure! O, when degree is shaked,[1131]
    Which is the ladder to all high designs,[1132]
    The enterprise is sick! How could communities,[1133]
    Degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities,
    Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,                         105
    The primogenitive and due of birth,[1134]
    Prerogative of age, crowns, sceptres, laurels,
    But by degree, stand in authentic place?
    Take but degree away, untune that string,
    And, hark, what discord follows! each thing meets[1135]          110
    In mere oppugnancy: the bounded waters
    Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores,[1136]
    And make a sop of all this solid globe:
    Strength should be lord of imbecility,[1137]
    And the rude son should strike his father dead:[1137]            115
    Force should be right; or rather, right and wrong,[1137]
    Between whose endless jar justice resides,[1138]
    Should lose their names, and so should justice too.[1136][1137][1139]
    Then every thing includes itself in power,[1140]
    Power into will, will into appetite;                             120
    And appetite, an universal wolf,
    So doubly seconded with will and power,
    Must make perforce an universal prey,
    And last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon,[1141]
    This chaos, when degree is suffocate,                            125
    Follows the choking.[1142]
    And this neglection of degree it is[1143]
    That by a pace goes backward, with a purpose[1144][1145]
    It hath to climb. The general's disdain'd[1144]
    By him one step below; he by the next;                           130
    That next by him beneath: so every step,
    Exampled by the first pace that is sick
    Of his superior, grows to an envious fever
    Of pale and bloodless emulation:
    And 'tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot,                     135
    Not her own sinews. To end a tale of length,
    Troy in our weakness stands, not in her strength.[1146]

    _Nest._ Most wisely hath Ulysses here discover'd
    The fever whereof all our power is sick.

    _Agam._ The nature of the sickness found, Ulysses,               140
    What is the remedy?

    _Ulyss._ The great Achilles, whom opinion crowns
    The sinew and the forehand of our host,[1147]
    Having his ear full of his airy fame,
    Grows dainty of his worth, and in his tent                       145
    Lies mocking our designs: with him, Patroclus,
    Upon a lazy bed, the livelong day
    Breaks scurril jests;[1148]
    And with ridiculous and awkward action,[1149]
    Which, slanderer, he imitation calls,                            150
    He pageants us. Sometime, great Agamemnon,[1150]
    Thy topless deputation he puts on;[1151]
    And, like a strutting player, whose conceit
    Lies in his hamstring, and doth think it rich
    To hear the wooden dialogue and sound                            155
    'Twixt his stretch'd footing and the scaffoldage,[1152]
    Such to-be-pitied and o'er-wrested seeming[1153]
    He acts thy greatness in: and when he speaks,
    'Tis like a chime a-mending; with terms unsquared,[1154]
    Which, from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropp'd,                160
    Would seem hyperboles. At this fusty stuff,[1155]
    The large Achilles, on his press'd bed lolling,[1156]
    From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause;
    Cries 'Excellent! 'tis Agamemnon just.[1157]
    Now play me Nestor; hem, and stroke thy beard,[1158]             165
    As he being dress'd to some oration.'[1159]
    That's done; as near as the extremest ends
    Of parallels, as like as Vulcan and his wife:[1160]
    Yet god Achilles still cries 'Excellent![1161]
    'Tis Nestor right. Now play him me, Patroclus,                   170
    Arming to answer in a night alarm.'
    And then, forsooth, the faint defects of age
    Must be the scene of mirth; to cough and spit.
    And, with a palsy fumbling on his gorget,[1162]
    Shake in and out the rivet: and at this sport[1163]              175
    Sir Valour dies; cries 'O, enough, Patroclus;
    Or give me ribs of steel! I shall split all[1164]
    In pleasure of my spleen.' And in this fashion,
    All our abilities, gifts, natures, shapes,
    Severals and generals of grace exact,[1165]                      180
    Achievements, plots, orders, preventions,
    Excitements to the field or speech for truce,
    Success or loss, what is or is not, serves
    As stuff for these two to make paradoxes.[1166]

    _Nest._ And in the imitation of these twain,                     185
    Who, as Ulysses says, opinion crowns[1167]
    With an imperial voice, many are infect.
    Ajax is grown self-will'd and bears his head
    In such a rein, in full as proud a place[1168]
    As broad Achilles; keeps his tent like him;[1169]                190
    Makes factious feasts; rails on our state of war
    Bold as an oracle, and sets Thersites,
    A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint,
    To match us in comparisons with dirt,
    To weaken and discredit our exposure,[1170]                      195
    How rank soever rounded in with danger.[1171]

    _Ulyss._ They tax our policy and call it cowardice,
    Count wisdom as no member of the war,
    Forestall prescience and esteem no act[1172]
    But that of hand: the still and mental parts                     200
    That do contrive how many hands shall strike
    When fitness calls them on, and know by measure[1173][1174]
    Of their observant toil the enemies' weight--[1173][1175]
    Why, this hath not a finger's dignity:
    They call this bed-work, mappery, closet-war;[1176]              205
    So that the ram that batters down the wall,
    For the great swing and rudeness of his poise,
    They place before his hand that made the engine,
    Or those that with the fineness of their souls[1177]
    By reason guide his execution.[1178]                             210

    _Nest._ Let this be granted, and Achilles' horse
    Makes many Thetis' sons.                            [_Tucket._[1179]

    _Agam._ What trumpet? look, Menelaus.[1180]

    _Men._ From Troy.

                          _Enter_ ÆNEAS.[1181]

    _Agam._ What would you 'fore our tent?                           215

    _Æne._ Is this great Agamemnon's tent, I pray you?

    _Agam._ Even this.

    _Æne._ May one that is a herald and a prince
    Do a fair message to his kingly ears?[1182]

    _Agam._ With surety stronger than Achilles' arm[1183]            220
    'Fore all the Greekish heads, which with one voice
    Call Agamemnon head and general.

    _Æne._ Fair leave and large security. How may
    A stranger to those most imperial looks
    Know them from eyes of other mortals?

    _Agam._                               How!                       225

    _Æne._ Ay:[1184]
    I ask, that I might waken reverence,
    And bid the cheek be ready with a blush[1185]
    Modest as morning when she coldly eyes[1186]
    The youthful Phœbus:[1186]                                       230
    Which is that god in office, guiding men?[1187]
    Which is the high and mighty Agamemnon?

    _Agam._ This Trojan scorns us; or the men of Troy
    Are ceremonious courtiers.

    _Æne._ Courtiers as free, as debonair, unarm'd,                  235
    As bending angels; that's their fame in peace:[1188]
    But when they would seem soldiers, they have galls,
    Good arms, strong joints, true swords; and, Jove's accord,[1189][1190]
    Nothing so full of heart. But peace, Æneas,[1189]
    Peace, Trojan; lay thy finger on thy lips!                       240
    The worthiness of praise distains his worth,
    If that the praised himself bring the praise forth:[1191]
    But what the repining enemy commends,[1192]
    That breath fame blows; that praise, sole pure, transcends.[1193]

    _Agam._ Sir, you of Troy, call you yourself Æneas?               245

    _Æne._ Ay, Greek, that is my name.

    _Agam._ What's your affair, I pray you?[1194]

    _Æne._ Sir, pardon; 'tis for Agamemnon's ears.

    _Agam._ He hears nought privately that comes from Troy.[1195]

    _Æne._ Nor I from Troy come not to whisper him:[1196]            250
    I bring a trumpet to awake his ear,
    To set his sense on the attentive bent,[1197]
    And then to speak.

    _Agam._            Speak frankly as the wind;
    It is not Agamemnon's sleeping hour:
    That thou shalt know, Trojan, he is awake,                       255
    He tells thee so himself.

    _Æne._                    Trumpet, blow loud,[1198]
    Send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents;
    And every Greek of mettle, let him know,
    What Troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud.

                                                [_Trumpet sounds._[1199]

    We have, great Agamemnon, here in Troy                           260
    A prince call'd Hector--Priam is his father--
    Who in this dull and long-continued truce[1200]
    Is rusty grown: he bade me take a trumpet,[1201]
    And to this purpose speak. Kings, princes, lords!
    If there be one among the fair'st of Greece,                     265
    That holds his honour higher than his ease,
    That seeks his praise more than he fears his peril,[1202]
    That knows his valour and knows not his fear,
    That loves his mistress more than in confession[1203]
    With truant vows to her own lips he loves,                       270
    And dare avow her beauty and her worth[1204]
    In other arms than hers--to him this challenge.
    Hector, in view of Trojans and of Greeks,
    Shall make it good, or do his best to do it,[1205]
    He hath a lady, wiser, fairer, truer,[1205]                      275
    Than ever Greek did compass in his arms;[1206]
    And will to-morrow with his trumpet call
    Midway between your tents and walls of Troy,
    To rouse a Grecian that is true in love:
    If any come, Hector shall honour him;                            280
    If none, he'll say in Troy when he retires,
    The Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth
    The splinter of a lance. Even so much.

    _Agam._ This shall be told our lovers, Lord Æneas:
    If none of them have soul in such a kind,                        285
    We left them all at home: but we are soldiers;[1207]
    And may that soldier a mere recreant prove,
    That means not, hath not, or is not in love!
    If then one is, or hath, or means to be,[1208]
    That one meets Hector; if none else, I am he.[1209]              290

    _Nest._ Tell him of Nestor, one that was a man
    When Hector's grandsire suck'd: he is old now;
    But if there be not in our Grecian host[1210]
    One noble man that hath one spark of fire,[1211]
    To answer for his love, tell him from me                         295
    I'll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver
    And in my vantbrace put this wither'd brawn,[1212]
    And meeting him will tell him that my lady[1213]
    Was fairer than his grandam and as chaste
    As may be in the world: his youth in flood,[1214]                300
    I'll prove this truth with my three drops of blood.[1215]

    _Æne._ Now heavens forbid such scarcity of youth![1216]

    _Ulyss._ Amen.[1217]

    _Agam._ Fair Lord Æneas, let me touch your hand;[1218]
    To our pavilion shall I lead you, sir.[1219]                     305
    Achilles shall have word of this intent;[1220]
    So shall each lord of Greece, from tent to tent:
    Yourself shall feast with us before you go,
    And find the welcome of a noble foe.

                             [_Exeunt all but Ulysses and Nestor._[1221]

    _Ulyss._ Nestor![1222]                                           310

    _Nest._ What says Ulysses?

    _Ulyss._ I have a young conception in my brain;
    Be you my time to bring it to some shape.

    _Nest._ What is't?

    _Ulyss._ This 'tis:[1223]                                        315
    Blunt wedges rive hard knots: the seeded pride
    That hath to this maturity blown up[1224]
    In rank Achilles must or now be cropp'd,
    Or, shedding, breed a nursery of like evil,
    To overbulk us all.

    _Nest._             Well, and how?[1225]                         320

    _Ulyss._ This challenge that the gallant Hector sends,
    However it is spread in general name,
    Relates in purpose only to Achilles.

    _Nest._ The purpose is perspicuous even as substance,[1226]
    Whose grossness little characters sum up:[1227]                  325
    And, in the publication, make no strain,[1227]
    But that Achilles, were his brain as barren[1228]
    As banks of Libya,--though, Apollo knows,[1229]
    'Tis dry enough--will, with great speed of judgement,[1229]
    Ay, with celerity, find Hector's purpose[1230]                   330
    Pointing on him.[1230]

    _Ulyss._ And wake him to the answer, think you?

    _Nest._ Yes, 'tis most meet: who may you else oppose,[1231]
    That can from Hector bring his honour off,[1232]
    If not Achilles? Though't be a sportful combat,[1233]            335
    Yet in this trial much opinion dwells;[1234]
    For here the Trojans taste our dear'st repute
    With their finest palate: and trust to me, Ulysses,[1235]
    Our imputation shall be oddly poised[1236]
    In this wild action; for the success,[1237]                      340
    Although particular, shall give a scantling[1238]
    Of good or bad unto the general;
    And in such indexes, although small pricks
    To their subsequent volumes, there is seen
    The baby figure of the giant mass                                345
    Of things to come at large. It is supposed
    He that meets Hector issues from our choice:
    And choice, being mutual act of all our souls,
    Makes merit her election, and doth boil,
    As 'twere from forth us all, a man distill'd                     350
    Out of our virtues; who miscarrying,
    What heart from hence receives the conquering part,[1239][1240]
    To steel a strong opinion to themselves?[1240][1241]
    Which entertain'd, limbs are his instruments,[1242][1243]
    In no less working than are swords and bows[1242]                355
    Directive by the limbs.[1242]

    _Ulyss._ Give pardon to my speech;[1244]
    Therefore 'tis meet Achilles meet not Hector.[1244][1245]
    Let us, like merchants, show our foulest wares,[1244]
    And think, perchance, they'll sell; if not,[1244][1246]          360
    The lustre of the better yet to show,[1244][1247]
    Shall show the better. Do not consent[1244][1248]
    That ever Hector and Achilles meet;[1244]
    For both our honour and our shame in this[1244]
    Are dogg'd with two strange followers.[1244]                     365

    _Nest._ I see them not with my old eyes: what are they?[1249]

    _Ulyss._ What glory our Achilles shares from Hector,[1250]
    Were he not proud, we all should share with him:[1251]
    But he already is too insolent;
    And we were better parch in Afric sun[1252]                      370
    Than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes,
    Should he 'scape Hector fair: if he were foil'd,[1253]
    Why then, we did our main opinion crush[1254]
    In taint of our best man. No, make a lottery;
    And by device let blockish Ajax draw[1255]                       375
    The sort to fight with Hector: among ourselves[1256]
    Give him allowance for the better man;[1257]
    For that will physic the great Myrmidon
    Who broils in loud applause, and make him fall
    His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends.                     380
    If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off,
    We'll dress him up in voices: if he fail,
    Yet go we under our opinion still
    That we have better men. But, hit or miss,
    Our project's life this shape of sense assumes,                  385
    Ajax employ'd plucks down Achilles' plumes.

    _Nest._ Ulysses,[1258]
    Now I begin to relish thy advice;[1258][1259]
    And I will give a taste of it forthwith[1260]
    To Agamemnon: go we to him straight.                             390
    Two curs shall tame each other: pride alone
    Must tarre the mastiffs on, as 'twere their bone.[1261]

                                                              [_Exeunt._

    will beat thee into handsomeness.                                 15

    _Ther._ I shall sooner rail thee into wit and holiness: but,
    I think, thy horse will sooner con an oration than thou[1269]
    learn a prayer without book. Thou canst strike, canst[1270]
    thou? a red murrain o' thy jade's tricks![1271]

    _Ajax._ Toadstool, learn me the proclamation.[1272]               20

    _Ther._ Dost thou think I have no sense, thou strikest
    me thus?

    _Ajax._ The proclamation!

    _Ther._ Thou art proclaimed a fool, I think.[1273]

    _Ajax._ Do not, porpentine, do not; my fingers itch.[1274]        25

    _Ther._ I would thou didst itch from head to foot, and I
    had the scratching of thee; I would make thee the loathsomest
    scab in Greece. When thou art forth in the incursions,[1275]
    thou strikest as slow as another.[1275]

    _Ajax._ I say, the proclamation!                                  30

    _Ther._ Thou grumblest and railest every hour on Achilles,
    and thou art as full of envy at his greatness as Cerberus
    is at Proserpina's beauty, ay, that thou barkest at him.[1276]

    _Ajax._ Mistress Thersites![1277]

    _Ther._ Thou shouldst strike him.[1278]                           35

    _Ajax._ Cobloaf![1278][1279]

    _Ther._ He would pun thee into shivers with his fist, as a[1278][1280]
    sailor breaks a biscuit.

    _Ajax._ [_Beating him_] You whoreson cur![1281][1282]

    _Ther._ Do, do.[1283]                                             40

    _Ajax._ Thou stool for a witch!

    _Ther._ Ay, do, do; thou sodden-witted lord! thou hast[1284]
    no more brain than I have in my elbows; an assinego[1285]
    may tutor thee: thou scurvy-valiant ass! thou art here but[1286]
    to thrash Trojans; and thou art bought and sold among[1287]       45
    those of any wit, like a barbarian slave. If thou use to
    beat me, I will begin at thy heel and tell what thou art by
    inches, thou thing of no bowels, thou![1288]

    _Ajax._ You dog!

    _Ther._ You scurvy lord!                                          50

    _Ajax._ [_Beating him_] You cur![1281]

    _Ther._ Mars his idiot! do, rudeness; do, camel, do, do.

                _Enter_ ACHILLES _and_ PATROCLUS.[1289]

    _Achil._ Why, how now, Ajax! wherefore do ye thus?[1290]
    How now, Thersites! what's the matter, man?

    _Ther._ You see him there, do you?                                55

    _Achil._ Ay; what's the matter?

    _Ther._ Nay, look upon him.

    _Achil._ So I do: what's the matter?

    _Ther._ Nay, but regard him well.

    _Achil._ 'Well!' why, so I do.[1291]                              60

    _Ther._ But yet you look not well upon him; for, whosoever[1292]
    you take him to be, he is Ajax.

    _Achil._ I know that, fool.

    _Ther._ Ay, but that fool knows not himself.

    _Ajax._ Therefore I beat thee.                                    65

    _Ther._ Lo, lo, lo, lo, what modicums of wit he utters! his
    evasions have ears thus long. I have bobbed his brain more[1293]
    than he has beat my bones: I will buy nine sparrows for a[1294]
    penny, and his pia mater is not worth the ninth part of a
    sparrow. This lord, Achilles, Ajax, who wears his wit in          70
    his belly and his guts in his head, I'll tell you what I say[1295]
    of him.

    _Achil._ What?

    _Ther._ I say, this Ajax--       [_Ajax offers to strike him._[1296]

    _Achil._ Nay, good Ajax.                                          75

    _Ther._ Has not so much wit--

    _Achil._ Nay, I must hold you.

    _Ther._ As will stop the eye of Helen's needle, for whom
    he comes to fight.

    _Achil._ Peace, fool!                                             80

    _Ther._ I would have peace and quietness, but the fool
    will not: he there: that he: look you there!

    _Ajax._ O thou damned cur! I shall--

    _Achil._ Will you set your wit to a fool's?

    _Ther._ No, I warrant you; for a fool's will shame it.[1297]      85

    _Patr._ Good words, Thersites.[1298]

    _Achil._ What's the quarrel?

    _Ajax._ I bade the vile owl go learn me the tenour of the[1299]
    proclamation, and he rails upon me.

    _Ther._ I serve thee not.                                         90

    _Ajax._ Well, go to, go to.

    _Ther._ I serve here voluntary.

    _Achil._ Your last service was sufferance, 'twas not voluntary;
    no man is beaten voluntary: Ajax was here the
    voluntary, and you as under an impress.                           95

    _Ther._ E'en so; a great deal of your wit too lies in[1300]
    your sinews, or else there be liars. Hector shall have a
    great catch, if he knock out either of your brains: a' were[1301]
    as good crack a fusty nut with no kernel.

    _Achil._ What, with me too, Thersites?                           100

    _Ther._ There's Ulysses and old Nestor, whose wit was
    mouldy ere your grandsires had nails on their toes, yoke[1302]
    you like draught-oxen, and make you plough up the wars.[1303]

    _Achil._ What? what?

    _Ther._ Yes, good sooth: to, Achilles! to, Ajax! to![1304]       105

    _Ajax._ I shall cut out your tongue.

    _Ther._ 'Tis no matter; I shall speak as much as thou[1305]
    afterwards.

    _Patr._ No more words, Thersites; peace![1306]

    _Ther._ I will hold my peace when Achilles' brooch bids[1307]    110
    me, shall I?

    _Achil._ There's for you, Patroclus.

    _Ther._ I will see you hanged, like clotpoles, ere I come[1308]
    any more to your tents: I will keep where there is wit stirring,
    and leave the faction of fools.                        [_Exit._  115

    _Patr._ A good riddance.

    _Achil._ Marry, this, sir, is proclaim'd through all our
    host:
    That Hector, by the fifth hour of the sun,[1309]
    Will with a trumpet 'twixt our tents and Troy
    To-morrow morning call some knight to arms                       120
    That hath a stomach, and such a one that dare
    Maintain--I know not what: 'tis trash. Farewell.[1310]

    _Ajax._ Farewell. Who shall answer him?[1311]

    _Achil._ I know not; 'tis put to lottery; otherwise
    He knew his man.                                                 125

    _Ajax._ O, meaning you. I will go learn more of it.[1312]

                                                                [Exeunt.


SCENE II. _Troy. A room in Priam's palace._[1313]

         _Enter_ PRIAM, HECTOR, TROILUS, PARIS, _and_ HELENUS.

    _Pri._ After so many hours, lives, speeches spent,[1314]
    Thus once again says Nestor from the Greeks:
    'Deliver Helen, and all damage else,[1315]
    As honour, loss of time, travail, expense,[1316]
    Wounds, friends, and what else dear that is consumed               5
    In hot digestion of this cormorant war,[1317]
    Shall be struck off.' Hector, what say you to't?[1318]

    _Hect._ Though no man lesser fears the Greeks than I
    As far as toucheth my particular,[1319][1320]
    Yet, dread Priam,[1319]                                           10
    There is no lady of more softer bowels,[1321]
    More spongy to suck in the sense of fear,
    More ready to cry out 'Who knows what follows?'
    Than Hector is: the wound of peace is surety,[1322][1323]
    Surety secure: but modest doubt is call'd[1323]                   15
    The beacon of the wise, the tent that searches
    To the bottom of the worst. Let Helen go.[1324]
    Since the first sword was drawn about this question,
    Every tithe soul, 'mongst many thousand dismes,
    Hath been as dear as Helen; I mean, of ours:                      20
    If we have lost so many tenths of ours,
    To guard a thing not ours, nor worth to us,[1325]
    Had it our name, the value of one ten,[1326]
    What merit's in that reason which denies[1327]
    The yielding of her up?

    _Tro._                  Fie, fie, my brother!                     25
    Weigh you the worth and honour of a king,[1328]
    So great as our dread father, in a scale[1329]
    Of common ounces? will you with counters sum
    The past proportion of his infinite?[1330]
    And buckle in a waist most fathomless[1331]                       30
    With spans and inches so diminutive
    As fears and reasons? fie, for godly shame![1332]

    _Hel._ No marvel, though you bite so sharp at reasons,[1333]
    You are so empty of them. Should not our father[1334]
    Bear the great sway of his affairs with reasons,[1335]            35
    Because your speech hath none that tells him so?[1336]

    _Tro._ You are for dreams and slumbers, brother priest;
    You fur your gloves with reason. Here are your reasons:[1337]
    You know an enemy intends you harm;
    You know a sword employ'd is perilous,                            40
    And reason flies the object of all harm:
    Who marvels then, when Helenus beholds
    A Grecian and his sword, if he do set
    The very wings of reason to his heels,
    And fly like chidden Mercury from Jove,[1338]                     45
    Or like a star disorb'd? Nay, if we talk of reason,[1338]
    Let's shut our gates, and sleep: manhood and honour[1339]
    Should have hare hearts, would they but fat their thoughts[1340]
    With this cramm'd reason: reason and respect
    Make livers pale and lustihood deject.[1341]                      50

    _Hect._ Brother, she is not worth what she doth cost[1342]
    The holding.[1342]

    _Tro._       What's aught, but as 'tis valued?[1343]

    _Hect._ But value dwells not in particular will;
    It holds his estimate and dignity[1344]
    As well wherein 'tis precious of itself                           55
    As in the prizer: 'tis mad idolatry[1345]
    To make the service greater than the god;[1346]
    And the will dotes, that is attributive[1347]
    To what infectiously itself affects,
    Without some image of the affected merit.[1348]                   60

    _Tro._ I take to-day a wife, and my election
    Is led on in the conduct of my will;
    My will enkindled by mine eyes and ears.[1349]
    Two traded pilots 'twixt the dangerous shores[1350]
    Of will and judgement: how may I avoid,[1351]                     65
    Although my will distaste what it elected,[1351]
    The wife I chose? there can be no evasion[1351][1352]
    To blench from this, and to stand firm by honour.
    We turn not back the silks upon the merchant
    When we have soil'd them, nor the remainder viands[1353]          70
    We do not throw in unrespective sieve,[1354]
    Because we now are full. It was thought meet[1355]
    Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks:
    Your breath of full consent bellied his sails;[1356]
    The seas and winds, old wranglers, took a truce,                  75
    And did him service: he touch'd the ports desired;
    And for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive
    He brought a Grecian queen, whose youth and freshness
    Wrinkles Apollo's and makes stale the morning.[1357]
    Why keep we her? the Grecians keep our aunt:                      80
    Is she worth keeping? why, she is a pearl,
    Whose price hath launch'd above a thousand ships,
    And turn'd crown'd kings to merchants.
    If you'll avouch 'twas wisdom Paris went,
    As you must needs, for you all cried 'Go, go,'                    85
    If you'll confess he brought home noble prize,[1358]
    As you must needs, for you all clapp'd your hands
    And cried 'Inestimable!' why do you now
    The issue of your proper wisdoms rate,[1359]
    And do a deed that Fortune never did,[1360]                       90
    Beggar the estimation which you prized
    Richer than sea and land? O, theft most base,
    That we have stol'n what we do fear to keep![1361]
    But thieves unworthy of a thing so stol'n,[1362]
    That in their country did them that disgrace[1363]                95
    We fear to warrant in our native place!

    _Cas._ [_Within_] Cry, Trojans, cry![1364][1365]

    _Pri._                               What noise? what shriek is this?

    _Tro._ 'Tis our mad sister, I do know her voice.

    _Cas._ [_Within_] Cry, Trojans![1365]

    _Hect._ It is Cassandra.                                         100

    _Enter_ CASSANDRA, _raving, with her hair about her ears_.[1366]

    _Cas._ Cry, Trojans, cry! lend me ten thousand eyes,[1367]
    And I will fill them with prophetic tears.

    _Hect._ Peace, sister, peace!

    _Cas._ Virgins and boys, mid age and wrinkled old,[1368]
    Soft infancy, that nothing canst but cry,[1369]                  105
    Add to my clamours! let us pay betimes[1370]
    A moiety of that mass of moan to come.
    Cry, Trojans, cry! practise your eyes with tears!
    Troy must not be, nor goodly Ilion stand;
    Our firebrand brother, Paris, burns us all.                      110
    Cry, Trojans, cry! a Helen and a woe:
    Cry, cry! Troy burns, or else let Helen go.                 [_Exit._

    _Hect._ Now, youthful Troilus, do not these high strains[1371]
    Of divination in our sister work
    Some touches of remorse? or is your blood                        115
    So madly hot that no discourse of reason,
    Nor fear of bad success in a bad cause,
    Can qualify the same?

    _Tro._                Why, brother Hector,
    We may not think the justness of each act[1372]
    Such and no other than event doth form it;                       120
    Nor once deject the courage of our minds,
    Because Cassandra's mad: her brain-sick raptures
    Cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel
    Which hath our several honours all engaged
    To make it gracious. For my private part,                        125
    I am no more touch'd than all Priam's sons:[1373]
    And Jove forbid there should be done amongst us
    Such things as might offend the weakest spleen
    To fight for and maintain!

    _Par._ Else might the world convince of levity[1374]             130
    As well my undertakings as your counsels:[1375]
    But I attest the gods, your full consent[1376]
    Gave wings to my propension and cut off
    All fears attending on so dire a project.
    For what, alas, can these my single arms?                        135
    What propugnation is in one man's valour,
    To stand the push and enmity of those
    This quarrel would excite? Yet, I protest,
    Were I alone to pass the difficulties[1377]
    And had as ample power as I have will,                           140
    Paris should ne'er retract what he hath done,
    Nor faint in the pursuit.

    _Pri._                    Paris, you speak
    Like one besotted on your sweet delights:
    You have the honey still, but these the gall;
    So to be valiant is no praise at all.                            145

    _Par._ Sir, I propose not merely to myself
    The pleasures such a beauty brings with it;
    But I would have the soil of her fair rape
    Wiped off, in honourable keeping her.
    What treason were it to the ransack'd queen,                     150
    Disgrace to your great worths, and shame to me,
    Now to deliver her possession up
    On terms of base compulsion! Can it be
    That so degenerate a strain as this
    Should once set footing in your generous bosoms?[1378]           155
    There's not the meanest spirit on our party,[1379]
    Without a heart to dare or sword to draw
    When Helen is defended, nor none so noble,[1380]
    Whose life were ill bestow'd or death unfamed
    Where Helen is the subject: then, I say,                         160
    Well may we fight for her, whom, we know well,
    The world's large spaces cannot parallel.

    _Hect._ Paris and Troilus, you have both said well;
    And on the cause and question now in hand[1381]
    Have glozed, but superficially; not much[1382]                   165
    Unlike young men, whom Aristotle thought[1383]
    Unfit to hear moral philosophy.
    The reasons you allege do more conduce
    To the hot passion of distemper'd blood
    Than to make up a free determination                             170
    'Twixt right and wrong; for pleasure and revenge
    Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice[1384]
    Of any true decision. Nature craves
    All dues be render'd to their owners: now,
    What nearer debt in all humanity                                 175
    Than wife is to the husband? If this law
    Of nature be corrupted through affection,
    And that great minds, of partial indulgence
    To their benumbed wills, resist the same,
    There is a law in each well-order'd nation[1385]                 180
    To curb those raging appetites that are
    Most disobedient and refractory.[1386]
    If Helen then be wife to Sparta's king,
    As it is known she is, these moral laws
    Of nature and of nations speak aloud[1387]                       185
    To have her back return'd: thus to persist
    In doing wrong extenuates not wrong,
    But makes it much more heavy. Hector's opinion
    Is this in way of truth: yet, ne'ertheless,
    My spritely brethren, I propend to you                           190
    In resolution to keep Helen still;
    For 'tis a cause that hath no mean dependance
    Upon our joint and several dignities.

    _Tro._ Why, there you touch'd the life of our design:[1388]
    Were it not glory that we more affected                          195
    Than the performance of our heaving spleens,
    I would not wish a drop of Trojan blood
    Spent more in her defence. But, worthy Hector,
    She is a theme of honour and renown;
    A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds,                         200
    Whose present courage may beat down our foes,
    And fame in time to come canonize us:
    For, I presume, brave Hector would not lose
    So rich advantage of a promised glory
    As smiles upon the forehead of this action                       205
    For the wide world's revenue.

    _Hect._                       I am yours,
    You valiant offspring of great Priamus.
    I have a roisting challenge sent amongst
    The dull and factious nobles of the Greeks
    Will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits:[1389]             210
    I was advertised their great general slept,
    Whilst emulation in the army crept:[1390]
    This, I presume, will wake him.                           [_Exeunt._


SCENE III. _The Grecian camp. Before the tent of Achilles._[1391]

                      _Enter_ THERSITES, _solus_.

    _Ther._ How now, Thersites! what, lost in the labyrinth[1392]
    of thy fury! Shall the elephant Ajax carry it thus? he
    beats me, and I rail at him: O, worthy satisfaction! would
    it were otherwise; that I could beat him, whilst he railed
    at me. 'Sfoot, I'll learn to conjure and raise devils, but I'll    5
    see some issue of my spiteful execrations. Then there's
    Achilles, a rare enginer. If Troy be not taken till these[1393]
    two undermine it, the walls will stand till they fall of themselves.
    O thou great thunder-darter of Olympus, forget
    that thou art Jove, the king of gods, and, Mercury, lose all      10
    the serpentine craft of thy caduceus, if ye take not that[1394]
    little little less than little wit from them that they have!
    which short-armed ignorance itself knows is so abundant[1395]
    scarce, it will not in circumvention deliver a fly from a
    spider, without drawing their massy irons and cutting the[1396]   15
    web. After this, the vengeance on the whole camp! or,
    rather, the Neapolitan bone-ache! for that, methinks, is the[1397]
    curse dependant on those that war for a placket. I have[1398]
    said my prayers; and devil Envy say amen. What, ho!
    my Lord Achilles!                                                 20

                        _Enter_ PATROCLUS.[1399]

    _Patr._ Who's there? Thersites! Good Thersites, come[1400]
    in and rail.

    _Ther._ If I could ha' remembered a gilt counterfeit,[1401]
    thou wouldst not have slipped out of my contemplation:[1402]
    but it is no matter; thyself upon thyself! The common             25
    curse of mankind, folly and ignorance, be thine in great
    revenue! heaven bless thee from a tutor, and discipline
    come not near thee! Let thy blood be thy direction till
    thy death! then if she that lays thee out says thou art a[1403]
    fair corse, I'll be sworn and sworn upon't she never shrouded     30
    any but lazars. Amen. Where's Achilles?[1404]

    _Patr._ What, art thou devout? wast thou in prayer?[1405]

    _Ther._ Ay; the heavens hear me!

    _Patr._ Amen.[1406]

                           _Enter_ ACHILLES.

    _Achil._ Who's there?                                             35

    _Patr._ Thersites, my lord..

    _Achil._ Where, where? Art thou come? why, my[1407]
    cheese, my digestion, why hast thou not served thyself in[1408]
    to my table so many meals? Come, what's Agamemnon?[1408]

    _Ther._ Thy commander, Achilles: then tell me, Patroclus,         40
    what's Achilles?

    _Patr._ Thy lord, Thersites: then tell me, I pray thee,[1409]
    what's thyself?

    _Ther._ Thy knower, Patroclus: then tell me, Patroclus,
    what art thou?                                                    45

    _Patr._ Thou mayst tell that knowest.[1410]

    _Achil._ O, tell, tell.

    _Ther._ I'll decline the whole question. Agamemnon
    commands Achilles; Achilles is my lord; I am Patroclus'
    knower, and Patroclus is a fool.                                  50

    _Patr._ You rascal![1411]

    _Ther._ Peace, fool! I have not done.[1411]

    _Achil._ He is a privileged man. Proceed, Thersites.[1411]

    _Ther._ Agamemnon is a fool; Achilles is a fool; Thersites[1411]
    is a fool, and, as aforesaid, Patroclus is a fool.[1411]          55

    _Achil._ Derive this; come.

    _Ther._ Agamemnon is a fool to offer to command
    Achilles; Achilles is a fool to be commanded of Agamemnon;[1412]
    Thersites is a fool to serve such a fool, and Patroclus[1413]
    is a fool positive.                                               60

    _Patr._ Why am I a fool?

    _Ther._ Make that demand of the prover. It suffices[1414]
    me thou art. Look you, who comes here?[1415]

    _Achil._ Patroclus, I'll speak with nobody. Come in[1416]
    with me, Thersites.                               [_Exit._[1417]  65

    _Ther._ Here is such patchery, such juggling and such
    knavery! all the argument is a cuckold and a whore; a[1418]
    good quarrel to draw emulous factions and bleed to death[1419]
    upon. Now, the dry serpigo on the subject! and war and[1420][1421]
    lechery confound all!                             [_Exit._[1420]  70

    _Enter_ AGAMEMNON, ULYSSES, NESTOR, DIOMEDES, _and_ AJAX.[1422]

    _Agam._ Where is Achilles?

    _Patr._ Within his tent; but ill-disposed, my lord.

    _Agam._ Let it be known to him that we are here.
    He shent our messengers; and we lay by[1423]
    Our appertainments, visiting of him:[1424]                        75
    Let him be told so, lest perchance he think[1425]
    We dare not move the question of our place,
    Or know not what we are.

    _Patr._                  I shall say so to him.       [_Exit._[1426]

    _Ulyss._ We saw him at the opening of his tent:
    He is not sick.                                                   80

    _Ajax._ Yes, lion-sick, sick of proud heart: you may call[1427]
    it melancholy, if you will favour the man; but, by my head,[1428]
    'tis pride: but why, why? let him show us the cause. A[1429][1430]
    word, my lord.                 [_Takes Agamemnon aside._[1430][1431]

    _Nest._ What moves Ajax thus to bay at him?                       85

    _Ulyss._ Achilles hath inveigled his fool from him.

    _Nest._ Who, Thersites?

    _Ulyss._ He.

    _Nest._ Then will Ajax lack matter, if he have lost his
    argument.                                                         90

    _Ulyss._ No, you see, he is his argument that has his
    argument, Achilles.

    _Nest._ All the better; their fraction is more our wish[1432]
    than their faction: but it was a strong composure a fool[1433]
    could disunite.                                                   95

    _Ulyss._ The amity that wisdom knits not, folly may[1434]
    easily untie.

                      _Re-enter_ PATROCLUS.[1435]

    Here comes Patroclus.[1436]

    _Nest._ No Achilles with him.[1437]

    _Ulyss._ The elephant hath joints, but none for courtesy:[1438]  100
    his legs are legs for necessity, not for flexure.[1438][1439]

    _Patr._ Achilles bids me say, he is much sorry,
    If any thing more than your sport and pleasure
    Did move your greatness and this noble state
    To call upon him; he hopes it is no other[1440]                  105
    But for your health and your digestion sake,
    An after-dinner's breath.

    _Agam._                   Hear you, Patroclus:[1441]
    We are too well acquainted with these answers:
    But his evasion, wing'd thus swift with scorn,[1442]
    Cannot outfly our apprehensions.                                 110
    Much attribute he hath, and much the reason
    Why we ascribe it to him: yet all his virtues,[1443]
    Not virtuously on his own part beheld,[1444]
    Do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss,
    Yea, like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish,[1445]               115
    Are like to rot untasted. Go and tell him,
    We come to speak with him; and you shall not sin,[1446]
    If you do say we think him over-proud
    And under-honest; in self-assumption greater[1447]
    Than in the note of judgement; and worthier than himself[1447][1448]  120
    Here tend the savage strangeness he puts on,[1449][1450]
    Disguise the holy strength of their command,[1450]
    And underwrite in an observing kind[1451]
    His humorous predominance; yea, watch
    His pettish lunes, his ebbs, his flows, as if[1452]              125
    The passage and whole carriage of this action[1453]
    Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,
    That if he overhold his price so much,
    We'll none of him, but let him, like an engine
    Not portable, lie under this report:[1454]                       130
    'Bring action hither, this cannot go to war:[1454][1455]
    A stirring dwarf we do allowance give[1454]
    Before a sleeping giant:' tell him so.[1454]

    _Patr._ I shall; and bring his answer presently.      [_Exit._[1456]

    _Agam._ In second voice we'll not be satisfied;                  135
    We come to speak with him. Ulysses, enter you.

                                                  [_Exit Ulysses._[1457]

    _Ajax._ What is he more than another?

    _Agam._ No more than what he thinks he is.

    _Ajax._ Is he so much? Do you not think he thinks
    himself a better man than I am?                                  140

    _Agam._ No question.

    _Ajax._ Will you subscribe his thought and say he is?

    _Agam._ No, noble Ajax; you are as strong, as valiant,
    as wise, no less noble, much more gentle and altogether[1458]
    more tractable.                                                  145

    _Ajax._ Why should a man be proud? How doth pride
    grow? I know not what pride is.[1459]

    _Agam._ Your mind is the clearer, Ajax, and your virtues[1460]
    the fairer. He that is proud eats up himself: pride is[1461]
    his own glass, his own trumpet, his own chronicle; and           150
    whatever praises itself but in the deed, devours the deed in[1462]
    the praise.

    _Ajax._ I do hate a proud man, as I hate the engendering[1463]
    of toads.

    _Nest._ [_Aside_] Yet he loves himself: is't not strange?        155

                       _Re-enter_ ULYSSES.[1464]

    _Ulyss._ Achilles will not to the field to-morrow.

    _Agam._ What's his excuse?

    _Ulyss._                   He doth rely on none,
    But carries on the stream of his dispose
    Without observance or respect of any,
    In will peculiar and in self-admission.[1465]                    160

    _Agam._ Why will he not, upon our fair request,
    Untent his person, and share the air with us?

    _Ulyss._ Things small as nothing, for request's sake only[1466]
    He makes important: possess'd he is with greatness,[1467]
    And speaks not to himself but with a pride                       165
    That quarrels at self-breath: imagined worth[1468]
    Holds in his blood such swoln and hot discourse
    That 'twixt his mental and his active parts
    Kingdom'd Achilles in commotion rages
    And batters down himself: what should I say?[1469][1470]         170
    He is so plaguy proud that the death-tokens of it[1469][1471]
    Cry 'No recovery.'

    _Agam._            Let Ajax go to him.
    Dear lord, go you and greet him in his tent:
    'Tis said he holds you well, and will be led[1472]
    At your request a little from himself.                           175

    _Ulyss._ O Agamemnon, let it not be so!
    We'll consecrate the steps that Ajax makes
    When they go from Achilles. Shall the proud lord
    That bastes his arrogance with his own seam[1473]
    And never suffers matter of the world                            180
    Enter his thoughts, save such as do revolve[1474]
    And ruminate himself, shall he be worshipp'd
    Of that we hold an idol more than he?[1475]
    No, this thrice worthy and right valiant lord
    Must not so stale his palm, nobly acquired;[1476]                185
    Nor, by my will, assubjugate his merit,
    As amply titled as Achilles is,[1477][1478]
    By going to Achilles:[1477]
    That were to enlard his fat-already pride,[1479]
    And add more coals to Cancer when he burns                       190
    With entertaining great Hyperion.
    This lord go to him! Jupiter forbid,[1480]
    And say in thunder 'Achilles go to him.'

    _Nest._ [_Aside_] O, this is well; he rubs the vein of him.[1481]

    _Dio._ [_Aside_] And how his silence drinks up this
              applause![1481][1482]  195

    _Ajax._ If I go to him, with my armed fist[1483]
    I'll pash him o'er the face.[1483][1484]

    _Agam._ O, no, you shall not go.

    _Ajax._ An a' be proud with me, I'll pheeze his pride:[1485][1486]
    Let me go to him.[1485]                                          200

    _Ulyss._ Not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel.

    _Ajax._ A paltry, insolent fellow![1487]

    _Nest._ [_Aside_] How he describes himself![1487][1488]

    _Ajax._ Can he not be sociable?[1487]

    _Ulyss._ [_Aside_] The raven chides blackness.[1487][1488]       205

    _Ajax._ I'll let his humours blood.[1487][1489]

    _Agam._ [_Aside_] He will be the physician that should[1487][1488][1490]
    be the patient.[1487]

    _Ajax._ An all men were o' my mind,--[1487][1491]

    _Ulyss._ [_Aside_] Wit would be out of fashion.[1487][1488]      210

    _Ajax._ A' should not bear it so, a' should eat swords[1487][1492]
    first: shall pride carry it?[1487]

    _Nest._ [_Aside_] An 'twould, you'ld carry half.[1487][1488][1493]

    _Ulyss._ [_Aside_] A' would have ten shares.[1487][1488][1494][1495]

    _Ajax._ I will knead him, I'll make him supple.[1487][1494][1496]  215

    _Nest._ [_Aside_] He's not yet through warm: force
        him[1487][1488][1494][1497]
    with praises: pour in, pour in; his ambition is dry.[1487][1498]

    _Ulyss._ [_To Agamemnon_] My lord, you feed too much[1499]
    on this dislike.

    _Nest._ Our noble general, do not do so.

    _Dio._ You must prepare to fight without Achilles.               220

    _Ulyss._ Why, 'tis this naming of him does him harm.[1500]
    Here is a man--but 'tis before his face;[1501]
    I will be silent.[1501]

    _Nest._           Wherefore should you so?
    He is not emulous, as Achilles is.

    _Ulyss._ Know the whole world, he is as valiant.[1502]           225

    _Ajax._ A whoreson dog, that shall palter thus with us![1503]
    Would he were a Trojan![1504]

    _Nest._ What a vice were it in Ajax now--[1505]

    _Ulyss._ If he were proud,--[1506]

    _Dio._ Or covetous of praise,--                                  230

    _Ulyss._ Ay, or surly borne,--

    _Dio._ Or strange, or self-affected!

    _Ulyss._ Thank the heavens, lord, thou art of sweet[1507]
    composure;
    Praise him that got thee, she that gave thee suck:[1508]
    Famed be thy tutor, and thy parts of nature[1509]                235
    Thrice-famed beyond, beyond all erudition:[1510]
    But he that disciplined thine arms to fight,[1511]
    Let Mars divide eternity in twain,
    And give him half: and, for thy vigour,[1512]
    Bull-bearing Milo his addition yield                             240
    To sinewy Ajax. I will not praise thy wisdom,[1513]
    Which, like a bourn, a pale, a shore, confines[1514]
    Thy spacious and dilated parts: here's Nestor,[1515]
    Instructed by the antiquary times,[1516]
    He must, he is, he cannot but be wise;                           245
    But pardon, father Nestor, were your days
    As green as Ajax', and your brain so temper'd,[1517]
    You should not have the eminence of him,
    But be as Ajax.[1518]

    _Ajax._         Shall I call you father?

    _Nest._ Ay, my good son.[1519]

    _Dio._                   Be ruled by him, Lord Ajax.             250

    _Ulyss._ There is no tarrying here; the hart Achilles
    Keeps thicket. Please it our great general[1520]
    To call together all his state of war:[1521]
    Fresh kings are come to Troy: to-morrow[1522]
    We must with all our main of power stand fast:                   255
    And here's a lord, come knights from east to west,
    And cull their flower, Ajax shall cope the best.[1523]

    _Agam._ Go we to council. Let Achilles sleep:[1524]
    Light boats sail swift, though greater hulks draw deep.[1525]

                                                              [_Exeunt._

    _Serv._ Faith, sir, superficially.                                10

    _Pan._ Friend, know me better; I am the Lord Pandarus.

    _Serv._ I hope I shall know your honour better.

    _Pan._ I do desire it.

    _Serv._ You are in the state of grace.[1531]

    _Pan._ Grace! not so, friend; honour and lordship are             15
    my titles. [_Music within._] What music is this?[1532]

    _Serv._ I do but partly know, sir: it is music in parts.[1533]

    _Pan._ Know you the musicians?

    _Serv._ Wholly, sir.

    _Pan._ Who play they to?                                          20

    _Serv._ To the hearers, sir.

    _Pan._ At whose pleasure, friend?

    _Serv._ At mine, sir, and theirs that love music.

    _Pan._ Command, I mean, friend.[1534]

    _Serv._ Who shall I command, sir?                                 25

    _Pan._ Friend, we understand not one another: I am
    too courtly, and thou art too cunning. At whose request[1535]
    do these men play?

    _Serv._ That's to't, indeed, sir: marry, sir, at the request
    of Paris my lord, who is there in person; with him, the[1536]     30
    mortal Venus, the heart-blood of beauty, love's invisible[1537]
    soul.[1538]

    _Pan._ Who, my cousin Cressida?

    _Serv._ No, sir, Helen: could not you find out that by[1539]
    her attributes?                                                   35

    _Pan._ It should seem, fellow, that thou hast not seen[1540]
    the Lady Cressida. I come to speak with Paris from the[1541]
    Prince Troilus: I will make a complimental assault upon
    him, for my business seethes.

    _Serv._ Sodden business! there's a stewed phrase indeed![1542]    40

              _Enter_ PARIS _and_ HELEN, _attended_.[1543]

    _Pan._ Fair be to you, my lord, and to all this fair company!
    fair desires, in all fair measure, fairly guide them!
    especially to you, fair queen! fair thoughts be your fair
    pillow!

    _Helen._ Dear lord, you are full of fair words.[1544]             45

    _Pan._ You speak your fair pleasure, sweet queen. Fair
    prince, here is good broken music.

    _Par._ You have broke it, cousin: and, by my life, you[1545]
    shall make it whole again; you shall piece it out with a
    piece of your performance. Nell, he is full of harmony.[1546]     50

    _Pan._ Truly, lady, no.

    _Helen._ O, sir,--

    _Pan._ Rude, in sooth; in good sooth, very rude.

    _Par._ Well said, my lord! well, you say so in fits.[1547]

    _Pan._ I have business to my lord, dear queen. My                 55
    lord, will you vouchsafe me a word?

    _Helen._ Nay, this shall not hedge us out: we'll hear[1548]
    you sing, certainly.

    _Pan._ Well, sweet queen, you are pleasant with me.
    But, marry, thus, my lord: my dear lord, and most esteemed        60
    friend, your brother Troilus--

    _Helen._ My Lord Pandarus; honey-sweet lord,--

    _Pan._ Go to, sweet queen, go to:--commends himself[1549]
    most affectionately to you--[1549]

    _Helen._ You shall not bob us out of our melody: if you[1550]     65
    do, our melancholy upon your head![1550]

    _Pan._ Sweet queen, sweet queen; that's a sweet queen,
    i' faith.[1551]

    _Helen._ And to make a sweet lady sad is a sour offence.[1552]

    _Pan._ Nay, that shall not serve your turn; that shall it[1553]   70
    not, in truth, la. Nay, I care not for such words; no, no.[1553]
    And, my lord, he desires you, that if the king call for him[1553]
    at supper, you will make his excuse.[1553][1554]

    _Helen._ My Lord Pandarus,--

    _Pan._ What says my sweet queen, my very very sweet[1555]         75
    queen?

    _Par._ What exploit's in hand? where sups he to-night?[1556]

    _Helen._ Nay, but, my lord,--

    _Pan._ What says my sweet queen? My cousin will[1557][1558]
    fall out with you. You must not know where he sups.[1557][1558][1559]  80

    _Par._ I'll lay my life, with my disposer Cressida.[1557][1560][1561]

    _Pan._ No, no, no such matter; you are wide: come,
    your disposer is sick.[1561]

    _Par._ Well, I'll make excuse.[1562]

    _Pan._ Ay, good my lord. Why should you say Cressida?             85
    no, your poor disposer's sick.[1561][1563]

    _Par._ I spy.[1564]

    _Pan._ You spy! what do you spy? Come, give me an
    instrument. Now, sweet queen.[1565]

    _Helen._ Why, this is kindly done.[1566]                          90

    _Pan._ My niece is horribly in love with a thing you[1567]
    have, sweet queen.

    _Helen._ She shall have it, my lord, if it be not my lord
    Paris.

    _Pan._ He! no, she'll none of him; they two are twain.[1568]      95

    _Helen._ Falling in, after falling out, may make them three.

    _Pan._ Come, come, I'll hear no more of this; I'll sing
    you a song now.

    _Helen._ Ay, ay, prithee now. By my troth, sweet lord,[1569]
    thou hast a fine forehead.                                       100

    _Pan._ Ay, you may, you may.[1570]

    _Helen._ Let thy song be love: this love will undo us all.
    O Cupid, Cupid, Cupid!

    _Pan._ Love! ay, that it shall, i'faith.

    _Par._ Ay, good now, love, love, nothing but love.               105

    _Pan._ In good troth, it begins so.                  [_Sings._[1571]

                Love, love, nothing but love, still more![1572]
                    For, O, love's bow[1573]
                    Shoots buck and doe:[1573][1574]
                    The shaft confounds,[1575][1576]                 110
                    Not that it wounds,[1575]
                But tickles still the sore.
                These lovers cry Oh! oh! they die:[1577]
                    Yet that which seems the wound to kill,[1578]
                Doth turn oh! oh! to ha! ha! he![1577][1579]         115
                    So dying love lives still:
                Oh! oh! a while, but ha! ha! ha![1577]
                Oh! oh! groans out for ha! ha! ha![1577]

    Heigh-ho![1580]

    _Helen._ In love, i'faith, to the very tip of the nose.          120

    _Par._ He eats nothing but doves, love, and that breeds[1581]
    hot blood and hot blood begets hot thoughts and hot
    thoughts beget hot deeds and hot deeds is love.[1582]

    _Pan._ Is this the generation of love? hot blood, hot[1583]
    thoughts and hot deeds? Why, they are vipers: is love a[1583][1584]  125
    generation of vipers? Sweet lord, who's afield to-day?[1583][1585]

    _Par._ Hector, Deiphobus, Helenus, Antenor, and all
    the gallantry of Troy: I would fain have armed to-day, but[1586]
    my Nell would not have it so. How chance my brother
    Troilus went not?                                                130

    _Helen._ He hangs the lip at something: you know all,
    Lord Pandarus.

    _Pan._ Not I, honey-sweet queen. I long to hear how
    they sped to-day. You'll remember your brother's excuse?

    _Par._ To a hair.                                                135

    _Pan._ Farewell, sweet queen.

    _Helen._ Commend me to your niece.

    _Pan._ I will, sweet queen.                                 [_Exit._

                                             [_A retreat sounded._[1587]

    _Par._ They're come from field: let us to Priam's hall,[1588]
    To greet the warriors. Sweet Helen, I must woo you               140
    To help unarm our Hector: his stubborn buckles,
    With these your white enchanting fingers touch'd,[1589]
    Shall more obey than to the edge of steel
    Or force of Greekish sinews; you shall do more
    Than all the island kings,--disarm great Hector.                 145

    _Helen._ 'Twill make us proud to be his servant, Paris;[1590]
    Yea, what he shall receive of us in duty
    Gives us more palm in beauty than we have,
    Yea, overshines ourself.

    _Par._ Sweet, above thought I love thee.       [_Exeunt._[1591]  150


SCENE II. _An orchard to Pandarus' house._

         _Enter_ PANDARUS _and_ TROILUS' Boy, _meeting_.[1592]

    _Pan._ How now! where's thy master? at my cousin[1593]
    Cressida's?

    _Boy._ No, sir; he stays for you to conduct him thither.[1594]

    _Pan._ O, here he comes.

                            _Enter_ TROILUS.

    How now, how now!                                                  5

    _Tro._ Sirrah, walk off.                          [_Exit Boy._[1595]

    _Pan._ Have you seen my cousin?

    _Tro._ No, Pandarus: I stalk about her door,
    Like a strange soul upon the Stygian banks[1596]
    Staying for waftage. O, be thou my Charon,                        10
    And give me swift transportance to those fields[1597]
    Where I may wallow in the lily-beds
    Proposed for the deserver! O gentle Pandarus,[1598]
    From Cupid's shoulder pluck his painted wings,
    And fly with me to Cressid!                                       15

    _Pan._ Walk here i' the orchard, I'll bring her straight.

                                                         [_Exit._[1599]

    _Tro._ I am giddy; expectation whirls me round.[1600]
    The imaginary relish is so sweet
    That it enchants my sense: what will it be,[1601]
    When that the watery palates taste indeed[1602]                   20
    Love's thrice repured nectar? death, I fear me,[1603]
    Swounding destruction, or some joy too fine,[1604]
    Too subtle-potent, tuned too sharp in sweetness,[1605]
    For the capacity of my ruder powers:[1606]
    I fear it much, and I do fear besides                             25
    That I shall lose distinction in my joys,
    As doth a battle, when they charge on heaps
    The enemy flying.

                       _Re-enter_ PANDARUS.[1607]

    _Pan._ She's making her ready, she'll come straight:
    you must be witty now. She does so blush, and fetches             30
    her wind so short, as if she were frayed with a sprite: I'll[1608]
    fetch her. It is the prettiest villain: she fetches her breath[1609]
    as short as a new-ta'en sparrow.                      [_Exit._[1610]

    _Tro._ Even such a passion doth embrace my bosom:
    My heart beats thicker than a feverous pulse;                     35
    And all my powers do their bestowing lose,
    Like vassalage at unawares encountering[1611]
    The eye of majesty.

               _Re-enter_ PANDARUS _with_ CRESSIDA.[1612]

    _Pan._ Come, come, what need you blush? shame's a[1613]
    baby. Here she is now: swear the oaths now to her that            40
    you have sworn to me. What, are you gone again? you
    must be watched ere you be made tame, must you? Come
    your ways, come your ways; an you draw backward, we'll[1614]
    put you i' the fills. Why do you not speak to her? Come,[1615]
    draw this curtain, and let's see your picture. Alas the day,[1616]  45
    how loath you are to offend daylight! an 'twere dark, you'ld
    close sooner. So, so; rub on, and kiss the mistress. How
    now! a kiss in fee-farm! build there, carpenter; the air is
    sweet. Nay, you shall fight your hearts out ere I part you.
    The falcon as the tercel, for all the ducks i' the river: go[1617]  50
    to, go to.

    _Tro._ You have bereft me of all words, lady.

    _Pan._ Words pay no debts, give her deeds: but she'll
    bereave you o' the deeds too, if she call your activity in[1618]
    question. What, billing again? Here's 'In witness whereof[1619]   55
    the parties interchangeably'--Come in, come in: I'll go get[1619]
    a fire.                                               [_Exit._[1620]

    _Cres._ Will you walk in, my lord?

    _Tro._ O Cressida, how often have I wished me thus![1621]

    _Cres._ Wished, my lord?--The gods grant--O my lord![1622]        60

    _Tro._ What should they grant? what makes this pretty
    abruption? What too curious dreg espies my sweet lady[1623]
    in the fountain of our love?

    _Cres._ More dregs than water, if my fears have eyes.[1624]

    _Tro._ Fears make devils of cherubins; they never see truly.[1625]  65

    _Cres._ Blind fear, that seeing reason leads, finds safer[1626]
    footing than blind reason stumbling without fear: to fear
    the worst oft cures the worse.[1627]

    _Tro._ O, let my lady apprehend no fear: in all Cupid's[1628]
    pageant there is presented no monster.[1628]                      70

    _Cres._ Nor nothing monstrous neither?[1629]

    _Tro._ Nothing, but our undertakings; when we vow to[1630]
    weep seas, live in fire, eat rocks, tame tigers; thinking it
    harder for our mistress to devise imposition enough than
    for us to undergo any difficulty imposed. This is the[1631]  75
    monstruosity in love, lady, that the will is infinite and the
    execution confined, that the desire is boundless and the
    act a slave to limit.

    _Cres._ They say, all lovers swear more performance than
    they are able, and yet reserve an ability that they never         80
    perform, vowing more than the perfection of ten and discharging
    less than the tenth part of one. They that have the
    voice of lions and the act of hares, are they not monsters?

    _Tro._ Are there such? such are not we: praise us as we
    are tasted, allow us as we prove; our head shall go bare till     85
    merit crown it: no perfection in reversion shall have a praise[1632]
    in present: we will not name desert before his birth, and,
    being born, his addition shall be humble. Few words to
    fair faith: Troilus shall be such to Cressid as what envy
    can say worst shall be a mock for his truth, and what[1633]       90
    truth can speak truest, not truer than Troilus.

    _Cres._ Will you walk in, my lord?

                       _Re-enter_ PANDARUS.[1634]

    _Pan._ What, blushing still? have you not done talking[1635]
    yet?

    _Cres._ Well, uncle, what folly I commit, I dedicate to           95
    you.

    _Pan._ I thank you for that: if my lord get a boy of you,
    you'll give him me. Be true to my lord: if he flinch, chide
    me for it.

    _Tro._ You know now your hostages; your uncle's word             100
    and my firm faith.

    _Pan._ Nay, I 'll give my word for her too: our kindred,
    though they be long ere they are wooed, they are constant[1636]
    being won: they are burs, I can tell you; they'll stick
    where they are thrown.                                           105

    _Cres._ Boldness comes to me now, and brings me heart.[1637]
    Prince Troilus, I have loved you night and day[1637]
    For many weary months.[1637]

    _Tro._ Why was my Cressid then so hard to win?

    _Cres._ Hard to seem won: but I was won, my lord,                110
    With the first glance that ever--pardon me;[1638]
    If I confess much, you will play the tyrant.
    I love you now; but not, till now, so much[1639]
    But I might master it: in faith, I lie;
    My thoughts were like unbridled children, grown[1640]            115
    Too headstrong for their mother. See, we fools!
    Why have I blabb'd? who shall be true to us,
    When we are so unsecret to ourselves?
    But, though I loved you well, I woo'd you not;
    And yet, good faith, I wish'd myself a man,                      120
    Or that we women had men's privilege[1641]
    Of speaking first. Sweet, bid me hold my tongue;
    For in this rapture I shall surely speak
    The thing I shall repent. See, see, your silence,[1642]
    Cunning in dumbness, from my weakness draws[1643]                125
    My very soul of counsel! Stop my mouth.[1644]

    _Tro._ And shall, albeit sweet music issues thence.[1645]

    _Pan._ Pretty, i' faith.

    _Cres._ My lord, I do beseech you, pardon me;
    'Twas not my purpose thus to beg a kiss:                         130
    I am ashamed; O heavens! what have I done?
    For this time will I take my leave, my lord.

    _Tro._ Your leave, sweet Cressid?[1646]

    _Pan._ Leave! an you take leave till to-morrow morning--[1647]

    _Cres._ Pray you, content you.[1648]                             135

    _Tro._ What offends you, lady?[1648]

    _Cres._ Sir, mine own company.[1648]

    _Tro._ You cannot shun yourself.[1648][1649]

    _Cres._ Let me go and try:[1648][1650]
    I have a kind of self resides with you,[1651]                    140
    But an unkind self that itself will leave
    To be another's fool. I would be gone:[1652]
    Where is my wit? I know not what I speak.[1652]

    _Tro._ Well know they what they speak that speak so wisely.[1653]

    _Cres._ Perchance, my lord, I show more craft than love,[1654]   145
    And fell so roundly to a large confession
    To angle for your thoughts: but you are wise;[1655]
    Or else you love not, for to be wise and love[1655][1656]
    Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.[1657]

    _Tro._ O that I thought it could be in a woman--                 150
    As, if it can, I will presume in you--[1658]
    To feed for aye her lamp and flames of love;[1659]
    To keep her constancy in plight and youth,
    Outliving beauty's outward, with a mind[1660]
    That doth renew swifter than blood decays!                       155
    Or that persuasion could but thus convince me,[1661]
    That my integrity and truth to you
    Might be affronted with the match and weight
    Of such a winnowed purity in love;[1662]
    How were I then uplifted! but, alas!                             160
    I am as true as truth's simplicity
    And simpler than the infancy of truth.

    _Cres._ In that I'll war with you.

    _Tro._                             O virtuous fight,
    When right with right wars who shall be most right![1663]
    True swains in love shall in the world to come[1664]             165
    Approve their truths by Troilus: when their rhymes,[1665]
    Full of protest, of oath and big compare,
    Want similes, truth tired with iteration,[1666]
    'As true as steel, as plantage to the moon,[1667]
    As sun to day, as turtle to her mate,                            170
    As iron to adamant, as earth to the centre,'
    Yet, after all comparisons of truth,[1668]
    As truth's authentic author to be cited,[1669]
    'As true as Troilus' shall crown up the verse[1670]
    And sanctify the numbers.

    _Cres._                   Prophet may you be!                    175
    If I be false, or swerve a hair from truth,
    When time is old and hath forgot itself,[1671]
    When waterdrops have worn the stones of Troy,
    And blind oblivion swallow'd cities up,
    And mighty states characterless are grated                       180
    To dusty nothing, yet let memory,
    From false to false, among false maids in love,
    Upbraid my falsehood! when they've said 'as false[1672]
    As air, as water, wind, or sandy earth,[1673]
    As fox to lamb, or wolf to heifer's calf,[1674]                  185
    Pard to the hind, or stepdame to her son,'
    'Yea,' let them say, to stick the heart of falsehood,
    'As false as Cressid.'

    _Pan._ Go to, a bargain made: seal it, seal it; I'll be the
    witness. Here I hold your hand; here my cousin's. If ever[1675]  190
    you prove false one to another, since I have taken such pains[1676]
    to bring you together, let all pitiful goers-between be called
    to the world's end after my name; call them all Pandars;
    let all constant men be Troiluses, all false women Cressids,[1677]
    and all brokers-between Pandars! Say 'amen.'                     195

    _Tro._ Amen.

    _Cres._ Amen.

    _Pan._ Amen. Whereupon I will show you a chamber[1678]
    with a bed; which bed, because it shall not speak of your[1678]
    pretty encounters, press it to death: away![1679]                200

                                                [_Exeunt Tro. and Cres._

    And Cupid grant all tongue-tied maidens here
    Bed, chamber, Pandar to provide this gear!

                                                          [_Exit._[1680]


SCENE III. _The Grecian camp._

     _Flourish. Enter_ AGAMEMNON, ULYSSES, DIOMEDES, NESTOR, AJAX,
                     MENELAUS, _and_ CALCHAS.[1681]

    _Cal._ Now, princes, for the service I have done you,[1682]
    The advantage of the time prompts me aloud
    To call for recompense. Appear it to your mind[1683]
    That, through the sight I bear in things to love,[1684]
    I have abandon'd Troy, left my possession,[1685]                   5
    Incurr'd a traitor's name; exposed myself,
    From certain and possess'd conveniences,
    To doubtful fortunes; sequestering from me all[1686]
    That time, acquaintance, custom and condition
    Made tame and most familiar to my nature,                         10
    And here, to do you service, am become
    As new into the world, strange, unacquainted:[1687]
    I do beseech you, as in way of taste,
    To give me now a little benefit,
    Out of those many register'd in promise,                          15
    Which, you say, live to come in my behalf.

    _Agam._ What wouldst thou of us, Trojan? make demand.

    _Cal._ You have a Trojan prisoner, call'd Antenor,
    Yesterday took: Troy holds him very dear.
    Oft have you--often have you thanks therefore--                   20
    Desired my Cressid in right great exchange,
    Whom Troy hath still denied: but this Antenor,
    I know, is such a wrest in their affairs[1688]
    That their negotiations all must slack,
    Wanting his manage; and they will almost[1689]                    25
    Give us a prince of blood, a son of Priam,[1690]
    In change of him: let him be sent, great princes,
    And he shall buy my daughter; and her presence
    Shall quite strike off all service I have done,
    In most accepted pain.

    _Agam._                Let Diomedes bear him,[1691]               30
    And bring us Cressid hither: Calchas shall have
    What he requests of us. Good Diomed,
    Furnish you fairly for this interchange:
    Withal, bring word if Hector will to-morrow[1692]
    Be answer'd in his challenge: Ajax is ready.                      35

    _Dio._ This shall I undertake; and 'tis a burthen
    Which I am proud to bear.            [_Exeunt Diomedes and Calchas._

      _Enter_ ACHILLES _and_ PATROCLUS, _before their tent_.[1693]

    _Ulyss._ Achilles stands i' the entrance of his tent:
    Please it our general pass strangely by him,[1694]
    As if he were forgot; and, princes all,                           40
    Lay negligent and loose regard upon him:
    I will come last. 'Tis like he'll question me
    Why such unplausive eyes are bent on him:[1695]
    If so, I have derision medicinable,[1696]
    To use between your strangeness and his pride,[1697]              45
    Which his own will shall have desire to drink.
    It may do good: pride hath no other glass
    To show itself but pride, for supple knees
    Feed arrogance and are the proud man's fees.

    _Agam._ We'll execute your purpose and put on                     50
    A form of strangeness as we pass along;
    So do each lord, and either greet him not
    Or else disdainfully, which shall shake him more
    Than if not look'd on. I will lead the way.

    _Achil._ What, comes the general to speak with me?                55
    You know my mind; I'll fight no more 'gainst Troy.

    _Agam._ What says Achilles? would he aught with us?

    _Nest._ Would you, my lord, aught with the general?

    _Achil._ No.

    _Nest._ Nothing, my lord.                                         60

    _Agam._ The better.            [_Exeunt Agamemnon and Nestor._[1698]

    _Achil._ Good day, good day.

    _Men._ How do you? how do you?                        [_Exit._[1699]

    _Achil._ What, does the cuckold scorn me?

    _Ajax._ How now, Patroclus!                                       65

    _Achil._ Good morrow, Ajax.

    _Ajax._ Ha?[1700]

    _Achil._ Good morrow.[1701]

    _Ajax._ Ay, and good next day too.                    [_Exit._[1702]

    _Achil._ What mean these fellows? Know they not Achilles?[1703]   70

    _Patr._ They pass by strangely: they were used to bend,[1704]
    To send their smiles before them to Achilles,
    To come as humbly as they used to creep[1705][1706]
    To holy altars.[1705]

    _Achil._ What, am I poor of late?
    'Tis certain, greatness, once fall'n out with fortune,            75
    Must fall out with men too: what the declined is,
    He shall as soon read in the eyes of others
    As feel in his own fall: for men, like butterflies,
    Show not their mealy wings but to the summer,
    And not a man, for being simply man,[1707]                        80
    Hath any honour, but honour for those honours[1708]
    That are without him, as place, riches, and favour,[1709]
    Prizes of accident as oft as merit:
    Which when they fall, as being slippery standers,
    The love that lean'd on them as slippery too,[1710]               85
    Do one pluck down another and together[1711][1712]
    Die in the fall. But 'tis not so with me:[1712]
    Fortune and I are friends: I do enjoy
    At ample point all that I did possess,
    Save these men's looks; who do, methinks, find out                90
    Something not worth in me such rich beholding[1713]
    As they have often given. Here is Ulysses:
    I'll interrupt his reading.[1714]
    How now, Ulysses![1714]

    _Ulyss._          Now, great Thetis' son![1715]

    _Achil._ What are you reading?

    _Ulyss._                       A strange fellow here              95
    Writes me: 'That man, how dearly ever parted,
    How much in having, or without or in,
    Cannot make boast to have that which he hath,
    Nor feels not what he owes, but by reflection;
    As when his virtues shining upon others[1716]                    100
    Heat them, and they retort that heat again
    To the first giver.'[1717]

    _Achil._             This is not strange, Ulysses.
    The beauty that is borne here in the face[1718]
    The bearer knows not, but commends itself[1719]
    To others' eyes: nor doth the eye itself,[1720]                  105
    That most pure spirit of sense, behold itself,[1720]
    Not going from itself; but eye to eye opposed[1721]
    Salutes each other with each other's form:[1722]
    For speculation turns not to itself,
    Till it hath travell'd and is married there[1723]                110
    Where it may see itself. This is not strange at all.[1724]

    _Ulyss._ I do not strain at the position--[1725]
    It is familiar--but at the author's drift;[1726]
    Who in his circumstance expressly proves
    That no man is the lord of any thing,[1727]                      115
    Though in and of him there be much consisting,[1728]
    Till he communicate his parts to others;
    Nor doth he of himself know them for aught
    Till he behold them formed in the applause[1729]
    Where they're extended; who, like an arch, reverberates[1730]    120
    The voice again; or, like a gate of steel
    Fronting the sun, receives and renders back
    His figure and his heat. I was much rapt in this;[1731]
    And apprehended here immediately[1731][1732]
    The unknown Ajax.[1731][1733]                                    125
    Heavens, what a man is there! a very horse;[1731][1733]
    That has he knows not what. Nature, what things there
              are,[1731][1733][1734]
    Most abject in regard and dear in use![1731][1733][1735]
    What things again most dear in the esteem[1733]
    And poor in worth! Now shall we see to-morrow--[1733][1736]      130
    An act that very chance doth throw upon him--[1733][1736][1737]
    Ajax renown'd. O heavens, what some men do,[1733][1736][1738]
    While some men leave to do![1733][1739]
    How some men creep in skittish fortune's hall,[1739][1740]
    While others play the idiots in her eyes![1739]                  135
    How one man eats into another's pride,
    While pride is fasting in his wantonness![1741]
    To see these Grecian lords! Why, even already
    They clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder,
    As if his foot were on brave Hector's breast[1742]               140
    And great Troy shrieking.[1743]

    _Achil._ I do believe it; for they pass'd by me[1744][1745]
    As misers do by beggars, neither gave to me[1744]
    Good word nor look: what, are my deeds forgot?[1744][1746]

    _Ulyss._ Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back                145
    Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,
    A great-sized monster of ingratitudes:[1747]
    Those scraps are good deeds past, which are devour'd[1748]
    As fast as they are made, forgot as soon[1748]
    As done: perseverance, dear my lord,[1748][1749][1750]           150
    Keeps honour bright: to have done, is to hang[1749]
    Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail[1751]
    In monumental mockery. Take the instant way;[1752]
    For honour travels in a strait so narrow,
    Where one but goes abreast: keep then the path;[1753]            155
    For emulation hath a thousand sons
    That one by one pursue: if you give way,
    Or hedge aside from the direct forthright,[1754]
    Like to an enter'd tide they all rush by
    And leave you hindmost:[1755][1756][1757]                        160
    Or, like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank,[1755][1756][1757][1758]
    Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,[1755][1756][1759][1760][1761]
    O'er-run and trampled on: then what they do in present,[1755][1756][1760]
    Though less than yours in past, must o'ertop yours;[1755][1762]
    For time is like a fashionable host[1755]                        165
    That slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand,[1755]
    And with his arms outstretch'd, as he would fly,[1755][1763]
    Grasps in the comer: welcome ever smiles,[1755][1764]
    And farewell goes out sighing. O, let not virtue seek[1755][1765][1766]
    Remuneration for the thing it was;[1755][1766][1767]             170
    For beauty, wit,[1755][1767]
    High birth, vigour of bone, desert in service,[1755][1768]
    Love, friendship, charity, are subjects all[1755][1769]
    To envious and calumniating time.
    One touch of nature makes the whole world kin;                   175
    That all with one consent praise new-born gawds,
    Though they are made and moulded of things past,
    And give to dust that is a little gilt[1770][1771]
    More laud than gilt o'er-dusted.[1770][1772]
    The present eye praises the present object:                      180
    Then marvel not, thou great and complete man,
    That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax;[1773]
    Since things in motion sooner catch the eye[1774]
    Than what not stirs. The cry went once on thee,[1775]
    And still it might, and yet it may again,                        185
    If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive
    And case thy reputation in thy tent,
    Whose glorious deeds, but in these fields of late,
    Made emulous missions 'mongst the gods themselves,[1776]
    And drave great Mars to faction.

    _Achil._                         Of this my privacy[1777]        190
    I have strong reasons.

    _Ulyss._               But 'gainst your privacy[1778]
    The reasons are more potent and heroical:
    'Tis known, Achilles, that you are in love
    With one of Priam's daughters.

    _Achil._                       Ha! known?[1779]

    _Ulyss._ Is that a wonder?                                       195
    The providence that's in a watchful state
    Knows almost every grain of Plutus' gold,[1780]
    Finds bottom in the uncomprehensive deeps,[1781]
    Keeps place with thought and almost like the gods[1782][1783]
    Does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles.[1782][1784]          200
    There is a mystery, with whom relation[1785]
    Durst never meddle, in the soul of state;
    Which hath an operation more divine
    Than breath or pen can give expressure to:[1786]
    All the commerce that you have had with Troy                     205
    As perfectly is ours as yours, my lord;
    And better would it fit Achilles much
    To throw down Hector than Polyxena:
    But it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home,
    When fame shall in our islands sound her trump;[1787]            210
    And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing
    'Great Hector's sister did Achilles win,
    But our great Ajax bravely beat down him.'[1788]
    Farewell, my lord: I as your lover speak;
    The fool slides o'er the ice that you should break. [_Exit._[1789]  215

    _Patr._ To this effect, Achilles, have I moved you:[1790]
    A woman impudent and mannish grown
    Is not more loathed than an effeminate man
    In time of action. I stand condemn'd for this;[1791]
    They think my little stomach to the war                          220
    And your great love to me restrains you thus:
    Sweet, rouse yourself, and the weak wanton Cupid[1792]
    Shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold,[1793]
    And, like a dew-drop from the lion's mane,[1794]
    Be shook to air.[1795]

    _Achil._         Shall Ajax fight with Hector?                   225

    _Patr._ Ay, and perhaps receive much honour by him.

    _Achil._ I see my reputation is at stake;
    My fame is shrewdly gored.[1796]

    _Patr._                    O, then, beware;
    Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves:
    Omission to do what is necessary                                 230
    Seals a commission to a blank of danger;
    And danger, like an ague, subtly taints
    Even then when we sit idly in the sun.[1797]

    _Achil._ Go call Thersites hither, sweet Patroclus:
    I'll send the fool to Ajax and desire him                        235
    To invite the Trojan lords after the combat
    To see us here unarm'd: I have a woman's longing,[1798]
    An appetite that I am sick withal,
    To see great Hector in his weeds of peace;[1799]
    To talk with him, and to behold his visage,                      240
    Even to my full of view.--A labour saved!

                        _Enter_ THERSITES.[1800]

    _Ther._ A wonder![1801]

    _Achil._ What?

    _Ther._ Ajax goes up and down the field, asking for himself.

    _Achil._ How so?                                                 245

    _Ther._ He must fight singly to-morrow with Hector,
    and is so prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling
    that he raves in saying nothing.

    _Achil._ How can that be?

    _Ther._ Why, a' stalks up and down like a peacock,--a[1802]      250
    stride and a stand: ruminates like an hostess that hath no
    arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning: bites his
    lip with a politic regard, as who should say 'There were wit
    in this head, an 'twould out:' and so there is; but it lies as[1803]
    coldly in him as fire in a flint, which will not show without    255
    knocking. The man's undone for ever; for if Hector break
    not his neck i' the combat, he'll break't himself in vainglory.[1804]
    He knows not me: I said 'Good morrow, Ajax;'
    and he replies 'Thanks, Agamemnon.' What think you of[1805]
    this man, that takes me for the general? He's grown a very       260
    land-fish, languageless, a monster. A plague of opinion! a
    man may wear it on both sides, like a leather jerkin.

    _Achil._ Thou must be my ambassador to him, Thersites.[1806]

    _Ther._ Who, I? why, he'll answer nobody; he professes
    not answering: speaking is for beggars; he wears his tongue      265
    in's arms. I will put on his presence: let Patroclus make
    demands to me, you shall see the pageant of Ajax.[1807]

    _Achil._ To him, Patroclus: tell him I humbly desire
    the valiant Ajax to invite the most valorous Hector to[1808]
    come unarmed to my tent, and to procure safe-conduct for         270
    his person of the magnanimous and most illustrious[1809]
    six-or-seven-times-honoured captain-general of the Grecian army,[1810]
    Agamemnon, et cetera. Do this.[1811]

    _Patr._ Jove bless great Ajax!

    _Ther._ Hum!                                                     275

    _Patr._ I come from the worthy Achilles,--

    _Ther._ Ha!

    _Patr._ Who most humbly desires you to invite Hector
    to his tent,--

    _Ther._ Hum!                                                     280

    _Patr._ And to procure safe-conduct from Agamemnon.

    _Ther._ Agamemnon?

    _Patr._ Ay, my lord.

    _Ther._ God be wi' you, with all my heart.[1812]

    _Patr._ Your answer, sir.

    _Ther._ If to-morrow be a fair day, by eleven of the[1813]
    clock it will go one way or other: howsoever, he shall pay
    for me ere he has me.                                            290

    _Patr._ Your answer, sir.

    _Ther._ Fare you well, with all my heart.[1814]

    _Achil._ Why, but he is not in this tune, is he?

    _Ther._ No, but he's out o' tune thus. What music will[1815][1816]
    be in him when Hector has knocked out his brains, I know[1816]   295
    not; but, I am sure, none, unless the fiddler Apollo get
    his sinews to make catlings on.

    _Achil._ Come, thou shalt bear a letter to him straight.

    _Ther._ Let me bear another to his horse; for that's the[1817]
    more capable creature.                                           300

    _Achil._ My mind is troubled like a fountain stirr'd,
    And I myself see not the bottom of it.

                                 [_Exeunt Achilles and Patroclus._[1818]

    _Ther._ Would the fountain of your mind were clear
    again, that I might water an ass at it! I had rather be a
    tick in a sheep than such a valiant ignorance.   [_Exit._[1819]  305

ACT IV.


SCENE I. _Troy. A street._

    _Enter, at one side_, ÆNEAS, _and_ Servant _with a torch; at
        the other_, PARIS, DEIPHOBUS, ANTENOR, DIOMEDES, _and
        others, with torches_.[1820]

    _Par._ See, ho! who is that there?[1821][1822]

    _Dei._ It is the Lord Æneas.[1822]

    _Æne._ Is the prince there in person?[1823]
    Had I so good occasion to lie long
    As you, Prince Paris, nothing but heavenly business[1824]          5
    Should rob my bed-mate of my company.

    _Dio._ That's my mind too. Good morrow, Lord Æneas.

    _Par._ A valiant Greek, Æneas,--take his hand,--
    Witness the process of your speech, wherein[1825]
    You told how Diomed a whole week by days[1825][1826]              10
    Did haunt you in the field.[1827]

    _Æne._ Health to you, valiant sir,[1828]
    During all question of the gentle truce;[1829]
    But when I meet you arm'd, as black defiance
    As heart can think or courage execute.                            15

    _Dio._ The one and other Diomed embraces.[1830]
    Our bloods are now in calm; and, so long, health;
    But when contention and occasion meet,[1831]
    By Jove, I'll play the hunter for thy life
    With all my force, pursuit and policy.[1832]                      20

    _Æne._ And thou shalt hunt a lion, that will fly
    With his face backward. In humane gentleness,[1833]
    Welcome to Troy! now, by Anchises' life,
    Welcome, indeed! By Venus' hand I swear,
    No man alive can love in such a sort                              25
    The thing he means to kill more excellently.

    _Dio._ We sympathise. Jove, let Æneas live,
    If to my sword his fate be not the glory,
    A thousand complete courses of the sun!
    But, in mine emulous honour, let him die,                         30
    With every joint a wound, and that to-morrow.[1834]

    _Æne._ We know each other well.[1835]

    _Dio._ We do; and long to know each other worse.[1835]

    _Par._ This is the most despiteful gentle greeting,[1836]
    The noblest hateful love, that e'er I heard of.[1837][1838]       35
    What business, lord, so early?[1837]

    _Æne._ I was sent for to the king; but why, I know not.

    _Par._ His purpose meets you: 'twas to bring this Greek[1839]
    To Calchas' house; and there to render him,[1840]
    For the enfreed Antenor, the fair Cressid:                        40
    Let's have your company, or, if you please,
    Haste there before us. I constantly do think,[1841]
    Or rather, call my thought a certain knowledge,
    My brother Troilus lodges there to-night:
    Rouse him and give him note of our approach,                      45
    With the whole quality wherefore: I fear[1842][1843]
    We shall be much unwelcome.[1843]

    _Æne._                      That I assure you:[1844][1845]
    Troilus had rather Troy were borne to Greece[1844]
    Than Cressid borne from Troy.[1844]

    _Par._                        There is no help;
    The bitter disposition of the time[1846]                          50
    Will have it so. On, lord; we'll follow you.[1846]

    _Æne._ Good morrow, all.                 [_Exit with Servant._[1847]

    _Par._ And tell me, noble Diomed, faith, tell me true,[1848]
    Even in the soul of sound good-fellowship,[1849]
    Who, in your thoughts, deserves fair Helen best,[1850]            55
    Myself or Menelaus?

    _Dio._              Both alike:
    He merits well to have her that doth seek her,
    Not making any scruple of her soilure,[1851]
    With such a hell of pain and world of charge;
    And you as well to keep her, that defend her,                     60
    Not palating the taste of her dishonour,
    With such a costly loss of wealth and friends:
    He, like a puling cuckold, would drink up
    The lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece;
    You, like a lecher, out of whorish loins                          65
    Are pleased to breed out your inheritors:
    Both merits poised, each weighs nor less nor more,[1852]
    But he as he, the heavier for a whore.[1853]

    _Par._ You are too bitter to your countrywoman.

    _Dio._ She's bitter to her country: hear me, Paris:               70
    For every false drop in her bawdy veins
    A Grecian's life hath sunk; for every scruple
    Of her contaminated carrion weight,
    A Trojan hath been slain: since she could speak,
    She hath not given so many good words breath                      75
    As for her Greeks and Trojans suffer'd death.

    _Par._ Fair Diomed, you do as chapmen do,
    Dispraise the thing that you desire to buy:[1854]
    But we in silence hold this virtue well,
    We'll not commend what we intend to sell.[1855]                   80
    Here lies our way.                                        [_Exeunt._


SCENE II. _Court of Pandarus' house._[1856]

                    _Enter_ TROILUS _and_ CRESSIDA.

    _Tro._ Dear, trouble not yourself: the morn is cold.

    _Cres._ Then, sweet my lord, I'll call mine uncle down;[1857]
    He shall unbolt the gates.

    _Tro._                     Trouble him not;
    To bed, to bed: sleep kill those pretty eyes,[1858]
    And give as soft attachment to thy senses                          5
    As infants' empty of all thought![1859]

    _Cres._                           Good morrow, then.

    _Tro._ I prithee now, to bed.

    _Cres._                       Are you a-weary of me?

    _Tro._ O Cressida! but that the busy day,
    Waked by the lark, hath roused the ribald crows,[1860]
    And dreaming night will hide our joys no longer,[1861]            10
    I would not from thee.

    _Cres._                Night hath been too brief.

    _Tro._ Beshrew the witch! with venomous wights she stays[1862]
    As tediously as hell, but flies the grasps of love[1863]
    With wings more momentary-swift than thought.[1864]
    You will catch cold, and curse me.

    _Cres._                            Prithee, tarry:[1865]          15
    You men will never tarry.[1865][1866]
    O foolish Cressid! I might have still held off,[1866][1867]
    And then you would have tarried. Hark! there's one up.[1868]

    _Pan._ [_Within_] What, 's all the doors open here?[1869]

    _Tro._ It is your uncle.                                          20

    _Cres._ A pestilence on him! now will he be mocking:
    I shall have such a life!

                        _Enter_ PANDARUS.[1870]

    _Pan._ How now, how now! how go maidenheads?[1871]
    Here, you maid! where's my cousin Cressid?[1871][1872]

    _Cres._ Go hang yourself, you naughty mocking uncle!              25
    You bring me to do--and then you flout me too.[1873]

    _Pan._ To do what? to do what? let her say what:[1874]
    what have I brought you to do?[1874]

    _Cres._ Come, come, beshrew your heart! you'll ne'er[1875]
    be good, nor suffer others.[1875]                                 30

    _Pan._ Ha, ha! Alas, poor wretch! a poor capocchia![1876]
    hast not slept to-night? would he not, a naughty man, let
    it sleep? a bugbear take him!

    _Cres._ Did not I tell you? would he were knock'd i'the
              head!                           [_One knocks._[1877][1878]
    Who's that at door? good uncle, go and see.[1878]                 35
    My lord, come you again into my chamber.[1878]
    You smile and mock me, as if I meant naughtily.[1878][1879]

    _Tro._ Ha, ha!

    _Cres._ Come, you are deceived, I think of no such thing.

                                                      [_Knocking._[1880]

    How earnestly they knock! Pray you, come in:                      40
    I would not for half Troy have you seen here.

                                   [_Exeunt Troilus and Cressida._[1881]

    down the door? How now! what's the matter?

    _Æne._ Good morrow, lord, good morrow.[1884]

    _Pan._ Who's there? my Lord Æneas! By my troth,[1885][1886]       45
    I knew you not: what news with you so early?[1885][1887]

    _Æne._ Is not prince Troilus here?

    _Pan._ Here! what should he do here?

    _Æne._ Come, he is here, my lord; do not deny him:
    It doth import him much to speak with me.                         50

    _Pan._ Is he here, say you? 'tis more than I know, I'll[1888]
    be sworn: for my own part, I came in late. What should[1889]
    he do here?

    _Æne._ Who! nay, then: come, come, you'll do him[1890][1891]
    wrong ere you are ware: you'll be so true to him, to be[1891][1892]  55
    false to him: do not you know of him, but yet go fetch[1891][1893]
    him hither; go.[1891]

                       _Re-enter_ TROILUS.[1894]

    _Tro._ How now! what's the matter?

    _Æne._ My lord, I scarce have leisure to salute you,
    My matter is so rash: there is at hand[1895]                      60
    Paris your brother and Deiphobus,
    The Grecian Diomed, and our Antenor
    Deliver'd to us; and for him forthwith,[1896]
    Ere the first sacrifice, within this hour,
    We must give up to Diomedes' hand[1897]                           65
    The Lady Cressida.

    _Tro._             Is it so concluded?[1898]

    _Æne._ By Priam and the general state of Troy.[1899]
    They are at hand and ready to effect it.[1900]

    _Tro._ How my achievements mock me![1901]
    I will go meet them: and, my Lord Æneas,                          70
    We met by chance; you did not find me here.

    _Æne._ Good, good, my lord; the secrets of nature[1902][1903]
    Have not more gift in taciturnity.[1902]

                                      [_Exeunt Troilus and Æneas._[1904]

    _Pan._ Is't possible? no sooner got but lost? The devil[1905]
    take Antenor! the young prince will go mad: a plague              75
    upon Antenor! I would they had broke's neck!

                       _Re-enter_ CRESSIDA.[1906]

    _Cres._ How now! what's the matter? who was here?

    _Pan._ Ah, ah![1907]

    _Cres._ Why sigh you so profoundly? where's my lord?
    gone! Tell me, sweet uncle, what's the matter?                    80

    _Pan._ Would I were as deep under the earth as I am
    above!

    _Cres._ O the gods! What's the matter?

    _Pan._ Prithee, get thee in: would thou hadst ne'er been[1908]
    born! I knew thou wouldst be his death: O, poor gentleman!        85
    A plague upon Antenor!

    _Cres._ Good uncle, I beseech you, on my knees I beseech[1909]
    you, what's the matter?[1909]

    _Pan._ Thou must be gone, wench, thou must be gone;
    thou art changed for Antenor: thou must to thy father,[1910]      90
    and be gone from Troilus: 'twill be his death; 'twill be his
    bane; he cannot bear it.[1911]

    _Cres._ O you immortal gods! I will not go.

    _Pan._ Thou must.

    _Cres._ I will not, uncle: I have forgot my father;[1912]         95
    I know no touch of consanguinity;
    No kin, no love, no blood, no soul so near me
    As the sweet Troilus. O you gods divine!
    Make Cressid's name the very crown of falsehood,
    If ever she leave Troilus! Time, force, and death,[1913]         100
    Do to this body what extremes you can;[1914]
    But the strong base and building of my love
    Is as the very centre of the earth,
    Drawing all things to it. I'll go in and weep,--[1915]

    _Pan._ Do, do.                                                   105

    _Cres._ Tear my bright hair and scratch my praised cheeks,[1916]
    Crack my clear voice with sobs and break my heart
    With sounding Troilus. I will not go from Troy.     [_Exeunt._[1917]


SCENE III. _Before Pandarus' house._[1918]

        _Enter_ PARIS, TROILUS, ÆNEAS, DEIPHOBUS, ANTENOR, _and_
                               DIOMEDES.

    _Par._ It is great morning, and the hour prefix'd
    For her delivery to this valiant Greek[1919]
    Comes fast upon: good my brother Troilus,[1920]
    Tell you the lady what she is to do,
    And haste her to the purpose.

    _Tro._                        Walk into her house;[1921]           5
    I'll bring her to the Grecian presently:
    And to his hand when I deliver her,
    Think it an altar, and thy brother Troilus
    A priest, there offering to it his own heart.         [_Exit._[1922]

    _Par._ I know what 'tis to love;                                  10
    And would, as I shall pity, I could help!
    Please you walk in, my lords.                             [_Exeunt._


SCENE IV. _A room in Pandarus' house._[1923]

                    _Enter_ PANDARUS _and_ CRESSIDA.

    _Pan._ Be moderate, be moderate.

    _Cres._ Why tell you me of moderation?
    The grief is fine, full, perfect, that I taste,
    And violenteth in a sense as strong[1924]
    As that which causeth it: how can I moderate it?[1924][1925]       5
    If I could temporise with my affection,[1926]
    Or brew it to a weak and colder palate,
    The like allayment could I give my grief:
    My love admits no qualifying dross;[1927]
    No more my grief, in such a precious loss.                        10

                         _Enter_ TROILUS.[1928]

    _Pan._ Here, here, here he comes. Ah, sweet ducks![1929]

    _Cres._ O Troilus! Troilus!                  [_Embracing him._[1930]

    _Pan._ What a pair of spectacles is here! Let me embrace
    too. 'O heart,' as the goodly saying is,[1931]

              'O heart, heavy heart,[1932]                            15
            Why sigh'st thou without breaking?'[1932][1933]

    where he answers again,

            'Because thou canst not ease thy smart[1934]
              By friendship nor by speaking.'[1934][1935]

    There was never a truer rhyme. Let us cast away nothing,          20
    for we may live to have need of such a verse: we see it, we
    see it. How now, lambs!

    _Tro._ Cressid, I love thee in so strain'd a purity,[1936]
    That the blest gods, as angry with my fancy,
    More bright in zeal than the devotion which                       25
    Cold lips blow to their deities, take thee from me.[1937]

    _Cres._ Have the gods envy?

    _Pan._ Ay, ay, ay, ay; 'tis too plain a case.[1938]

    _Cres._ And is it true that I must go from Troy?

    _Tro._ A hateful truth.

    _Cres._                 What, and from Troilus too?               30

    _Tro._ From Troy and Troilus.

    _Cres._                       Is it possible?[1939]

    _Tro._ And suddenly; where injury of chance[1940]
    Puts back leave-taking, justles roughly by[1941]
    All time of pause, rudely beguiles our lips
    Of all rejoindure, forcibly prevents                              35
    Our lock'd embrasures, strangles our dear vows[1942]
    Even in the birth of our own labouring breath:
    We two, that with so many thousand sighs
    Did buy each other, must poorly sell ourselves[1943]
    With the rude brevity and discharge of one.[1944]                 40
    Injurious time now with a robber's haste[1945]
    Crams his rich thievery up, he knows not how:
    As many farewells as be stars in heaven,
    With distinct breath and consign'd kisses to them,
    He fumbles up into a loose adieu,[1946]                           45
    And scants us with a single famish'd kiss,
    Distasted with the salt of broken tears.[1947]

    _Æneas._ [_Within_] My lord, is the lady ready?[1948]

    _Tro._ Hark! you are call'd: some say the Genius so[1949]
    Cries 'Come!' to him that instantly must die.[1949]               50
    Bid them have patience; she shall come anon.

    _Pan._ Where are my tears? rain, to lay this wind, or my[1950]
    heart will be blown up by the root.             [_Exit._[1950][1951]

    _Cres._ I must then to the Grecians?[1952]

    _Tro._                               No remedy.[1953]

    _Cres._ A woeful Cressid 'mongst the merry Greeks![1954]          55
    When shall we see again?[1955]

    _Tro._ Hear me, my love: be thou but true of heart.[1955][1956]

    _Cres._ I true! how now! what wicked deem is this?

    _Tro._ Nay, we must use expostulation kindly,[1957]
    For it is parting from us:[1957]                                  60
    I speak not 'be thou true,' as fearing thee;
    For I will throw my glove to Death himself,
    That there's no maculation in thy heart:[1958]
    But 'be thou true' say I, to fashion in
    My sequent protestation; be thou true,[1959]                      65
    And I will see thee.[1959]

    _Cres._ O, you shall be exposed, my lord, to dangers
    As infinite as imminent: but I'll be true.

    _Tro._ And I'll grow friend with danger. Wear this sleeve.[1960]

    _Cres._ And you this glove. When shall I see you?[1961]           70

    _Tro._ I will corrupt the Grecian sentinels,
    To give thee nightly visitation.[1962]
    But yet, be true.[1962]

    _Cres._           O heavens! 'Be true' again!

    _Tro._ Hear why I speak it, love:[1963]
    The Grecian youths are full of quality;[1963][1964]               75
    They're loving, well composed with gifts of nature,[1963]
    And flowing o'er with arts and exercise:[1963]
    How novelties may move and parts with person,[1965]
    Alas, a kind of godly jealousy--[1966]
    Which, I beseech you, call a virtuous sin--                       80
    Makes me afeard.[1967]

    _Cres._          O heavens! you love me not.

    _Tro._ Die I a villain then!
    In this I do not call your faith in question,
    So mainly as my merit: I cannot sing,[1968]
    Nor heel the high lavolt, nor sweeten talk,                       85
    Nor play at subtle games; fair virtues all,
    To which the Grecians are most prompt and pregnant:
    But I can tell that in each grace of these
    There lurks a still and dumb-discoursive devil
    That tempts most cunningly: but be not tempted.                   90

    _Cres._ Do you think I will?[1969]

    _Tro._ No:[1970]
    But something may be done that we will not:
    And sometimes we are devils to ourselves,
    When we will tempt the frailty of our powers,[1971]               95
    Presuming on their changeful potency.[1972]

    _Æne._ [_Within_] Nay, good my lord!

    _Tro._                               Come, kiss; and let us part.

    _Par._ [_Within_] Brother Troilus!

    _Tro._                             Good brother, come you hither;
    And bring Æneas and the Grecian with you.

    _Cres._ My lord, will you be true?[1973]                         100

    _Tro._ Who, I? alas, it is my vice, my fault:
    Whiles others fish with craft for great opinion,[1974]
    I with great truth catch mere simplicity;
    Whilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns,[1975]
    With truth and plainness I do wear mine bare.[1976]              105
    Fear not my truth: the moral of my wit[1977]
    Is 'plain and true;' there's all the reach of it.[1978]

    _Enter_ ÆNEAS, PARIS, ANTENOR, DEIPHOBUS, _and_ DIOMEDES.[1979]

    Welcome, Sir Diomed! here is the lady[1980]
    Which for Antenor we deliver you:[1981]
    At the port, lord, I'll give her to thy hand;                    110
    And by the way possess thee what she is.
    Entreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair Greek,
    If e'er thou stand at mercy of my sword,
    Name Cressid, and thy life shall be as safe
    As Priam is in Ilion.

    _Dio._                Fair Lady Cressid,[1982]                   115
    So please you, save the thanks this prince expects:
    The lustre in your eye, heaven in your cheek,
    Pleads your fair usage; and to Diomed[1983]
    You shall be mistress, and command him wholly.

    _Tro._ Grecian, thou dost not use me courteously,                120
    To shame the zeal of my petition to thee[1984]
    In praising her: I tell thee, lord of Greece,[1985]
    She is as far high-soaring o'er thy praises
    As thou unworthy to be call'd her servant.
    I charge thee use her well, even for my charge;                  125
    For, by the dreadful Pluto, if thou dost not,
    Though the great bulk Achilles be thy guard,
    I'll cut thy throat.[1986]

    _Dio._               O, be not moved, Prince Troilus:
    Let me be privileged by my place and message
    To be a speaker free; when I am hence,                           130
    I'll answer to my lust: and know you, lord,[1987]
    I'll nothing do on charge: to her own worth
    She shall be prized; but that you say 'Be't so,'
    I'll speak it in my spirit and honour 'No!'[1988]

    _Tro._ Come, to the port. I'll tell thee, Diomed,[1989]          135
    This brave shall oft make thee to hide thy head.
    Lady, give me your hand; and, as we walk,
    To our own selves bend we our needful talk.

                              [_Exeunt Troilus, Cressida, and Diomedes._
                                              [_A trumpet sounds._[1990]

    _Par._ Hark! Hector's trumpet.

    _Æne._                         How have we spent this morning!
    The prince must think me tardy and remiss,                       140
    That swore to ride before him to the field.[1991]

    _Par._ 'Tis Troilus' fault: come, come, to field with him.[1992]

    _Dei._ Let us make ready straight.[1993][1994]

    _Æne._ Yea, with a bridegroom's fresh alacrity,[1993]
    Let us address to tend on Hector's heels:[1993]                  145
    The glory of our Troy doth this day lie[1993]
    On his fair worth and single chivalry.        [_Exeunt._[1993][1995]


SCENE V. _The Grecian camp. Lists set out._

    _Enter_ AJAX, _armed_; AGAMEMNON, ACHILLES, PATROCLUS, MENELAUS,
                  ULYSSES, NESTOR, _and others_.[1996]

    _Agam._ Here art thou in appointment fresh and fair,
    Anticipating time with starting courage.[1997]
    Give with thy trumpet a loud note to Troy,
    Thou dreadful Ajax, that the appalled air
    May pierce the head of the great combatant[1998]                   5
    And hale him hither.[1998]

    _Ajax._              Thou, trumpet, there's my purse.[1999]
    Now crack thy lungs, and split thy brazen pipe:
    Blow, villain, till thy sphered bias cheek[2000]
    Outswell the colic of puff'd Aquilon:[2001]
    Come, stretch thy chest, and let thy eyes spout blood;            10
    Thou blow'st for Hector.                    [_Trumpet sounds._[2002]

    _Ulyss._ No trumpet answers.

    _Achil._                     'Tis but early days.[2003]

    _Agam._ Is not yond Diomed, with Calchas' daughter?[2004]

    _Ulyss._ 'Tis he, I ken the manner of his gait;
    He rises on the toe: that spirit of his[2005]                     15
    In aspiration lifts him from the earth.

                _Enter_ DIOMEDES, _with_ CRESSIDA.[2006]

    _Agam._ Is this the Lady Cressid?[2007]

    _Dio._                            Even she.

    _Agam._ Most dearly welcome to the Greeks, sweet lady.[2008][2009]

    Nest. Our general doth salute you with a kiss.[2010]

    _Ulyss._ Yet is the kindness but particular;[2010][2011][2012]    20
    'Twere better she were kiss'd in general.[2010][2011]

    _Nest._ And very courtly counsel: I'll begin.[2010][2011]
    So much for Nestor.[2009][2011]

    _Achil._ I'll take that winter from your lips, fair lady:[2013]
    Achilles bids you welcome.[2009]                                  25

    _Men._ I had good argument for kissing once.

    _Patr._ But that's no argument for kissing now;
    For thus popp'd Paris in his hardiment,[2014]
    And parted thus you and your argument.[2009][2015]

    _Ulyss._ O deadly gall, and theme of all our scorns!              30
    For which we lose our heads to gild his horns.

    _Patr._ The first was Menelaus' kiss; this, mine:
    Patroclus kisses you.[2016]

    _Men._                O, this is trim!

    _Patr._ Paris and I kiss evermore for him.

    _Men._ I 'll have my kiss, sir. Lady, by your leave.              35

    _Cres._ In kissing, do you render or receive?[2017]

    _Patr._ Both take and give.

    _Cres._                     I'll make my match to live,[2018]
    The kiss you take is better than you give;[2019]
    Therefore no kiss.[2019]

    _Men._ I'll give you boot, I'll give you three for one.           40

    _Cres._ You're an odd man; give even, or give none.[2020]

    _Men._ An odd man, lady! every man is odd.

    _Cres._ No, Paris is not; for, you know, 'tis true,
    That you are odd, and he is even with you.

    _Men._ You fillip me o' the head.[2021]

    _Cres._                                No, I'll be sworn.         45

    _Ulyss._ It were no match, your nail against his horn.
    May I, sweet lady, beg a kiss of you?

    _Cres._ You may.

    _Ulyss._         I do desire it.

    _Cres._                          Why, beg then.[2022]

    _Ulyss._ Why then, for Venus' sake, give me a kiss,
    When Helen is a maid again, and his.[2023]                        50

    _Cres._ I am your debtor; claim it when 'tis due.

    _Ulyss._ Never's my day, and then a kiss of you.[2024]

    _Dio._ Lady, a word: I 'll bring you to your father.[2025]

                                            [_Exit with Cressida._[2026]

    _Nest._ A woman of quick sense.[2025]

    _Ulyss._                        Fie, fie upon her!
    There's language in her eye, her cheek, her lip,[2027]            55
    Nay, her foot speaks; her wanton spirits look out
    At every joint and motive of her body.
    O, these encounterers, so glib of tongue,[2028]
    That give a coasting welcome ere it comes,[2029]
    And wide unclasp the tables of their thoughts                     60
    To every ticklish reader! set them down[2030]
    For sluttish spoils of opportunity[2031]
    And daughters of the game.                  [_Trumpet within._[2032]

    _All._ The Trojans' trumpet.

    _Agam._                      Yonder comes the troop.

     _Flourish. Enter_ HECTOR, _armed_; ÆNEAS, TROILUS, _and other_
                   Trojans, _with_ Attendants.[2033]

    _Æne._ Hail, all the state of Greece! what shall be done[2034]    65
    To him that victory commands? or do you purpose[2035]
    A victor shall be known? will you the knights
    Shall to the edge of all extremity
    Pursue each other, or shall they be divided[2036]
    By any voice or order of the field?[2037]                         70
    Hector bade ask.[2037]

    _Agam._          Which way would Hector have it?

    _Æne._ He cares not; he'll obey conditions.

    _Achil._ Tis done like Hector; but securely done,[2038][2039]
    A little proudly, and great deal misprizing[2038][2040]
    The knight opposed.[2041]

    _Æne._              If not Achilles, sir,                         75
    What is your name?

    _Achil._           If not Achilles, nothing.[2041]

    _Æne._ Therefore Achilles: but, whate'er, know this:[2042]
    In the extremity of great and little,[2042]
    Valour and pride excel themselves in Hector;[2043]
    The one almost as infinite as all,                                80
    The other blank as nothing. Weigh him well,[2044]
    And that which looks like pride is courtesy.
    This Ajax is half made of Hector's blood:
    In love whereof, half Hector stays at home;
    Half heart, half hand, half Hector comes to seek[2045]            85
    This blended knight, half Trojan and half Greek.

    _Achil._ A maiden battle then? O, I perceive you.

                       _Re-enter_ DIOMEDES.[2046]

    _Agam._ Here is Sir Diomed. Go, gentle knight,[2047]
    Stand by our Ajax: as you and Lord Æneas
    Consent upon the order of their fight,                            90
    So be it; either to the uttermost,[2048]
    Or else a breath: the combatants being kin[2049]
    Half stints their strife before their strokes begin.

                               [_Ajax and Hector enter the lists._[2050]

    _Ulyss._ They are opposed already.[2051]

    _Agam._ What Trojan is that same that looks so heavy?[2051][2052]  95

    _Ulyss._ The youngest son of Priam, a true knight,[2053]
    Not yet mature, yet matchless, firm of word,[2054]
    Speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue,[2055]
    Not soon provoked nor being provoked soon calm'd;
    His heart and hand both open and both free;[2056]                100
    For what he has he gives, what thinks he shows;[2056]
    Yet gives he not till judgement guide his bounty,
    Nor dignifies an impair thought with breath;[2057]
    Manly as Hector, but more dangerous;
    For Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes                      105
    To tender objects, but he in heat of action[2058]
    Is more vindicative than jealous love:[2059]
    They call him Troilus, and on him erect
    A second hope, as fairly built as Hector.
    Thus says Æneas; one that knows the youth                        110
    Even to his inches, and with private soul
    Did in great Ilion thus translate him to me.

                                 [_Alarum. Hector and Ajax fight._[2060]

    _Agam._ They are in action.[2061]

    _Nest._ Now, Ajax, hold thine own!

    _Tro._                             Hector, thou sleep'st;[2062]
    Awake thee![2062]                                                115

    _Agam._ His blows are well disposed: there, Ajax![2063]

    _Dio._ You must no more.                          [_Trumpets cease._

    _Æne._                   Princes, enough, so please you.[2064]

    _Ajax._ I am not warm yet; let us fight again.

    _Dio._ As Hector pleases.

    _Hect._                   Why, then will I no more:
    Thou art, great lord, my father's sister's son,                  120
    A cousin-german to great Priam's seed;
    The obligation of our blood forbids
    A gory emulation 'twixt us twain:
    Were thy commixtion Greek and Trojan so,[2065]
    That thou couldst say 'This hand is Grecian all,                 125
    And this is Trojan; the sinews of this leg
    All Greek, and this all Troy; my mother's blood[2066]
    Runs on the dexter cheek, and this sinister
    Bounds in my father's;' by Jove multipotent,
    Thou shouldst not bear from me a Greekish member                 130
    Wherein my sword had not impressure made
    Of our rank feud: but the just gods gainsay[2067]
    That any drop thou borrow'dst from thy mother,[2068]
    My sacred aunt, should by my mortal sword
    Be drained! Let me embrace thee, Ajax:[2069]                     135
    By him that thunders, thou hast lusty arms;
    Hector would have them fall upon him thus:
    Cousin, all honour to thee!

    _Ajax._                    I thank thee, Hector:
    Thou art too gentle and too free a man:
    I came to kill thee, cousin, and bear hence                      140
    A great addition earned in thy death.

    _Hect._ Not Neoptolemus so mirable,[2070]
    On whose bright crest Fame with her loud'st Oyes
    Cries 'This is he,' could promise to himself[2071]
    A thought of added honour torn from Hector.                      145

    _Æne._ There is expectance here from both the sides,
    What further you will do.

    _Hect._                   We'll answer it;
    The issue is embracement: Ajax, farewell.[2072]

    _Ajax._ If I might in entreaties find success,--
    As seld I have the chance--I would desire                        150
    My famous cousin to our Grecian tents.

    _Dio._ 'Tis Agamemnon's wish; and great Achilles
    Doth long to see unarm'd the valiant Hector.

    _Hect._ Æneas, call my brother Troilus to me:
    And signify this loving interview                                155
    To the expecters of our Trojan part;
    Desire them home. Give me thy hand, my cousin;
    I will go eat with thee, and see your knights.[2073]

    _Ajax._ Great Agamemnon comes to meet us here.

    _Hect._ The worthiest of them tell me name by name;              160
    But for Achilles, my own searching eyes[2074]
    Shall find him by his large and portly size.

    _Agam._ Worthy of arms! as welcome as to one[2075]
    That would be rid of such an enemy;
    But that's no welcome: understand more clear,[2076]              165
    What's past and what's to come is strew'd with husks[2076]
    And formless ruin of oblivion;[2076]
    But in this extant moment, faith and troth,[2076]
    Strain'd purely from all hollow bias-drawing,[2076][2077]
    Bids thee, with most divine integrity,[2076]                     170
    From heart of very heart, great Hector, welcome.

    _Hect._ I thank thee, most imperious Agamemnon.

    _Agam._ [_To Troilus_] My well-famed lord of Troy, no less to you.

    _Men._ Let me confirm my princely brother's greeting;
    You brace of warlike brothers, welcome hither.                   175

    _Hect._ Who must we answer?

    _Æne._                      The noble Menelaus.[2078]

    _Hect._ O, you, my lord! by Mars his gauntlet, thanks![2079]
    Mock not, that I affect the untraded oath;[2080]
    Your quondam wife swears still by Venus' glove:[2081]
    She's well, but bade me not commend her to you.                  180

    _Men._ Name her not now, sir; she's a deadly theme.

    _Hect._ O, pardon; I offend.

    _Nest._ I have, thou gallant Trojan, seen thee oft,
    Labouring for destiny, make cruel way
    Through ranks of Greekish youth; and I have seen thee,           185
    As hot as Perseus, spur thy Phrygian steed,
    Despising many forfeits and subduements,[2082]
    When thou hast hung thy advanced sword i' the air,[2083]
    Not letting it decline on the declined,
    That I have said to some my standers by[2084]                    190
    'Lo, Jupiter is yonder, dealing life!'
    And I have seen thee pause and take thy breath,
    When that a ring of Greeks have hemm'd thee in,[2085]
    Like an Olympian wrestling: this have I seen;[2086]
    But this thy countenance, still lock'd in steel,                 195
    I never saw till now. I knew thy grandsire,
    And once fought with him: he was a soldier good;
    But, by great Mars the captain of us all,
    Never like thee. Let an old man embrace thee;[2087]
    And, worthy warrior, welcome to our tents.                       200

    _Æne._ 'Tis the old Nestor.

    _Hect._ Let me embrace thee, good old chronicle,
    That hast so long walk'd hand in hand with time:
    Most reverend Nestor, I am glad to clasp thee.

    _Nest._ I would my arms could match thee in contention,          205
    As they contend with thee in courtesy.[2088]

    _Hect._ I would they could.

    _Nest._ Ha![2089]
    By this white beard, I'ld fight with thee to-morrow:
    Well, welcome, welcome!--I have seen the time.[2090]             210

    _Ulyss._ I wonder now how yonder city stands
    When we have here her base and pillar by us.[2091]

    _Hect._ I know your favour, Lord Ulysses, well.
    Ah, sir, there's many a Greek and Trojan dead,
    Since first I saw yourself and Diomed                            215
    In Ilion, on your Greekish embassy.[2092]

    _Ulyss._ Sir, I foretold you then what would ensue:
    My prophecy is but half his journey yet;
    For yonder walls, that pertly front your town,[2093]
    Yond towers, whose wanton tops do buss the clouds,[2094]         220
    Must kiss their own feet.

    _Hect._                   I must not believe you:
    There they stand yet; and modestly I think,
    The fall of every Phrygian stone will cost
    A drop of Grecian blood: the end crowns all,
    And that old common arbitrator, Time,[2095]                      225
    Will one day end it.[2095]

    _Ulyss._             So to him we leave it.
    Most gentle and most valiant Hector, welcome:
    After the general, I beseech you next
    To feast with me and see me at my tent.

    _Achil._ I shall forestall thee, Lord Ulysses, thou![2096]       230
    Now, Hector, I have fed mine eyes on thee;
    I have with exact view perused thee, Hector,[2097]
    And quoted joint by joint.[2097][2098]

    _Hect._                    Is this Achilles?

    _Achil._ I am Achilles.[2099]

    _Hect._ Stand fair, I pray thee: let me look on thee.[2100]      235

    _Achil._ Behold thy fill.

    _Hect._                   Nay, I have done already.

    _Achil._ Thou art too brief: I will the second time,[2101]
    As I would buy thee, view thee limb by limb.[2102]

    _Hect._ O, like a book of sport thou'lt read me o'er;
    But there's more in me than thou understand'st.                  240
    Why dost thou so oppress me with thine eye?

    _Achil._ Tell me, you heavens, in which part of his body
    Shall I destroy him? whether there, or there, or there?[2103]
    That I may give the local wound a name,
    And make distinct the very breach whereout                       245
    Hector's great spirit flew: answer me, heavens!

    _Hect._ It would discredit the blest gods, proud man,
    To answer such a question: stand again:
    Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
    As to prenominate in nice conjecture                             250
    Where thou wilt hit me dead?

    _Achil._                        I tell thee, yea.

    _Hect._ Wert thou an oracle to tell me so,[2104]
    I'ld not believe thee. Henceforth guard thee well;
    For I'll not kill thee there, nor there, nor there;
    But, by the forge that stithied Mars his helm,[2105]             255
    I'll kill thee every where, yea, o'er and o'er.
    You wisest Grecians, pardon me this brag;
    His insolence draws folly from my lips;
    But I'll endeavour deeds to match these words,
    Or may I never--

    _Ajax._          Do not chafe thee, cousin:                      260
    And you, Achilles, let these threats alone
    Till accident or purpose bring you to't:
    You may have every day enough of Hector,[2106]
    If you have stomach: the general state, I fear,
    Can scarce entreat you to be odd with him.[2107]                 265

    _Hect._ I pray you, let us see you in the field:
    We have had pelting wars since you refused[2108]
    The Grecians' cause.[2108]

    _Achil._             Dost thou entreat me, Hector?
    To-morrow do I meet thee, fell as death;[2109]
    To-night all friends.[2109]

    _Hect._               Thy hand upon that match.[2110]            270

    _Agam._ First, all you peers of Greece, go to my tent;
    There in the full convive we: afterwards,[2111]
    As Hector's leisure and your bounties shall
    Concur together, severally entreat him.[2112]
    Beat loud the tabourines, let the trumpets blow,[2112]           275
    That this great soldier may his welcome know.

                            [_Exeunt all but Troilus and Ulysses._[2113]

    _Tro._ My Lord Ulysses, tell me, I beseech you.[2114]
    In what place of the field doth Calchas keep?

    _Ulyss._ At Menelaus' tent, most princely Troilus:
    There Diomed doth feast with him to-night;                       280
    Who neither looks upon the heaven nor earth,[2115]
    But gives all gaze and bent of amorous view
    On the fair Cressid.

    _Tro._ Shall I, sweet lord, be bound to you so much,[2116]
    After we part from Agamemnon's tent,                             285
    To bring me thither?

    _Ulyss._             You shall command me, sir.
    As gentle tell me, of what honour was[2117]
    This Cressida in Troy? Had she no lover there[2118]
    That wails her absence?[2118]

    _Tro._ O, sir, to such as boasting show their scars,             290
    A mock is due. Will you walk on, my lord?
    She was beloved, she loved; she is, and doth:[2119]
    But still sweet love is food for fortune's tooth.         [_Exeunt._

    of idiot-worshippers, here's a letter for thee.

    _Achil._ From whence, fragment?

    _Ther._ Why, thou full dish of fool, from Troy.

    _Patr._ Who keeps the tent now?                                   10

    _Ther._ The surgeon's box, or the patient's wound.

    _Patr._ Well said, adversity! and what need these tricks?[2126]

    _Ther._ Prithee, be silent, boy; I profit not by thy talk:[2127]
    thou art thought to be Achilles' male varlet.[2128][2129]

    _Patr._ Male varlet, you rogue! what's that?[2129]                15

    _Ther._ Why, his masculine whore. Now, the rotten diseases[2130]
    of the south, the guts-griping, ruptures, catarrhs, loads[2131]
    o' gravel i' the back, lethargies, cold palsies, raw eyes,[2132][2133]
    dirt-rotten livers, wheezing lungs, bladders full of imposthume,[2133][2134]
    sciaticas, limekilns i' the palm, incurable bone-ache, and
        the[2133][2135]  20
    rivelled fee-simple of the tetter, take and take again such[2133]
    preposterous discoveries![2136]

    _Patr._ Why, thou damnable box of envy, thou, what
    mean'st thou to curse thus?[2137]

    _Ther._ Do I curse thee?                                          25

    _Patr._ Why, no, you ruinous butt; you whoreson indistinguishable[2138]
    cur, no.[2139]

    _Ther._ No! why art thou then exasperate, thou idle
    immaterial skein of sleave silk, thou green sarcenet flap for[2140]
    a sore eye, thou tassel of a prodigal's purse, thou? Ah,[2141]    30
    how the poor world is pestered with such waterflies, diminutives
    of nature!

    _Patr._ Out, gall![2142]

    _Ther._ Finch-egg!

    _Achil._ My sweet Patroclus, I am thwarted quite[2143]            35
    From my great purpose in to-morrow's battle.
    Here is a letter from Queen Hecuba,
    A token from her daughter, my fair love,
    Both taxing me and gaging me to keep
    An oath that I have sworn. I will not break it:                   40
    Fall Greeks; fail fame; honour or go or stay;[2144]
    My major vow lies here, this I'll obey.
    Come, come, Thersites, help to trim my tent:
    This night in banqueting must all be spent.[2145]
    Away, Patroclus!   [_Exeunt Achilles and Patroclus._[2145][2146]  45

    _Ther._ With too much blood and too little brain, these
    two may run mad; but, if with too much brain and too little
    blood they do, I'll be a curer of madmen. Here's Agamemnon,
    an honest fellow enough and one that loves quails;[2147]
    but he has not so much brain as ear-wax: and the goodly[2148]     50
    transformation of Jupiter there, his brother, the bull, the[2149]
    primitive statue and oblique memorial of cuckolds; a thrifty[2150]
    shoeing-horn in a chain, hanging at his brother's leg,--to[2151]
    what form but that he is, should wit larded with malice and[2152]
    malice forced with wit turn him to? To an ass, were nothing;[2153]  55
    he is both ass and ox: to an ox, were nothing; he is[2154]
    both ox and ass. To be a dog, a mule, a cat, a fitchew, a[2154][2155]
    toad, a lizard, an owl, a puttock, or a herring without a roe,[2156]
    I would not care; but to be Menelaus! I would conspire[2157]
    against destiny. Ask me not what I would be, if I were[2158]      60
    not Thersites; for I care not to be the louse of a lazar, so I
    were not Menelaus. Hoy-day! spirits and fires!

       _Enter_ HECTOR, TROILUS, AJAX, AGAMEMNON, ULYSSES, NESTOR,
             MENELAUS, _and_ DIOMEDES, _with lights_.[2159]

    _Agam._ We go wrong, we go wrong.[2160]

    _Ajax._                           No, yonder 'tis;[2161]
    There, where we see the lights.[2162]

    _Hect._                         I trouble you.[2161]

    _Ajax._ No, not a whit.

                       _Re-enter_ ACHILLES.[2163]

    _Ulyss._                Here comes himself to guide you.          65

    _Achil._ Welcome, brave Hector; welcome, princes all.

    _Agam._ So now, fair Prince of Troy, I bid good night.[2164]
    Ajax commands the guard to tend on you.[2165]

    _Hect._ Thanks and good night to the Greeks' general.[2166]

    _Men._ Good night, my lord.

    _Hect._                     Good night, sweet Lord Menelaus.[2167]  70

    _Ther._ Sweet draught: sweet, quoth a'! sweet sink, sweet[2168]
    sewer.[2169]

    _Achil._ Good night and welcome, both at once, to those[2170][2171]
    That go or tarry.[2170][2172]

    _Agam._ Goodnight.       [_Exeunt Agamemnon and Menelaus._[2173]  75

    _Achil._ Old Nestor tarries; and you too, Diomed,[2174]
    Keep Hector company an hour or two.

    _Dio._ I cannot, lord; I have important business,
    The tide whereof is now. Good night, great Hector.

    _Hect._ Give me your hand.                                        80

    _Ulyss._ [_Aside to Troilus_] Follow his torch; he goes to
               Calchas' tent:[2175][2176][2177]
    I'll keep you company.[2176]

    _Tro._                   Sweet sir, you honour me.

    _Hect._ And so, good night.

                  [_Exit Diomedes; Ulysses and Troilus following._[2178]

    _Achil._ Come, come, enter my tent.

                     [_Exeunt Achilles, Hector, Ajax, and Nestor._[2179]

    _Ther._ That same Diomed's a false-hearted rogue, a most          85
    unjust knave; I will no more trust him when he leers than
    I will a serpent when he hisses: he will spend his mouth
    and promise, like Brabbler the hound; but when he performs,
    astronomers foretell it; it is prodigious, there will[2180]
    come some change; the sun borrows of the moon when[2181]          90
    Diomed keeps his word. I will rather leave to see Hector
    than not to dog him: they say he keeps a Trojan drab
    and uses the traitor Calchas' tent: I'll after. Nothing but[2182]
    lechery! all incontinent varlets!                     [_Exit._[2183]


SCENE II. _The same. Before Calchas' tent._

                        _Enter_ DIOMEDES.[2184]

    _Dio._ What, are you up here, ho? speak.[2185]

    _Cal._ [_Within_] Who calls?[2186]

    _Dio._ Diomed. Calchas, I think. Where's your daughter?[2187]

    _Cal._ [_Within_] She comes to you.[2186]

      _Enter_ TROILUS _and_ ULYSSES, _at a distance; after them_,
                           THERSITES.[2188]

    _Ulyss._ Stand where the torch may not discover us.                5

                        _Enter_ CRESSIDA.[2189]

    _Tro._ Cressid comes forth to him.[2190]

    _Dio._                             How now, my charge!

    _Cres._ Now, my sweet guardian! Hark, a word with
              you.                                    [_Whispers._[2191]

    _Tro._ Yea, so familiar!

    _Ulyss._ She will sing any man at first sight.[2192]

    _Ther._ And any man may sing her, if he can take her[2193]        10
    cliff; she's noted.[2193]

    _Dio._ Will you remember?[2194]

    _Cres._ Remember! yes.[2195]

    _Dio._ Nay, but do, then;[2196]
    And let your mind be coupled with your words.[2197]               15

    _Tro._ What should she remember?[2198]

    _Ulyss._ List.

    _Cres._ Sweet honey Greek, tempt me no more to folly.

    _Ther._ Roguery!

    _Dio._ Nay, then,--                                               20

    _Cres._ I'll tell you what,--

    _Dio._ Foh, foh! come, tell a pin: you are forsworn.[2199]

    _Cres._ In faith, I cannot: what would you have me do?[2200]

    _Ther._ A juggling trick,--to be secretly open.

    _Dio._ What did you swear you would bestow on me?                 25

    _Cres._ I prithee, do not hold me to mine oath;
    Bid me do any thing but that, sweet Greek.[2201]

    _Dio._ Good night.

    _Tro._ Hold, patience![2202]

    _Ulyss._ How now, Trojan!                                         30

    _Cres._ Diomed,--

    _Dio._ No, no, good night: I'll be your fool no more.

    _Tro._ Thy better must.

    _Cres._ Hark, one word in your ear.[2203]

    _Tro._ O plague and madness!                                      35

    _Ulyss._ You are moved, prince; let us depart, I pray you,[2204]
    Lest your displeasure should enlarge itself
    To wrathful terms: this place is dangerous;
    The time right deadly; I beseech you, go.

    _Tro._ Behold, I pray you!

    _Ulyss._                   Nay, good my lord, go off:[2205]       40
    You flow to great distraction; come, my lord.[2206]

    _Tro._ I pray thee, stay.[2207]

    _Ulyss._                  You have not patience; come.

    _Tro._ I pray you, stay; by hell and all hell's torments,[2208]
    I will not speak a word.[2209]

    _Dio._                   And so, good night.

    _Cres._ Nay, but you part in anger.

    _Tro._                              Doth that grieve thee?[2210]  45
    O wither'd truth![2210]

    _Ulyss._          Why, how now, lord![2211]

    _Tro._                               By Jove,[2212]
    I will be patient.[2212]

    _Cres._            Guardian!--why, Greek!

    _Dio._ Foh, foh! adieu; you palter.[2213]

    _Cres._ In faith, I do not: come hither once again.

    _Ulyss._ You shake, my lord, at something: will you go?[2214]     50
    You will break out.[2214]

    _Tro._              She strokes his cheek!

    _Ulyss._                                   Come, come.

    _Tro._ Nay, stay; by Jove, I will not speak a word:
    There is between my will and all offences
    A guard of patience: stay a little while.

    _Ther._ How the devil luxury, with his fat rump and               55
    potato-finger, tickles these together! Fry, lechery, fry![2215]

    _Dio._ But will you, then?[2216]

    _Cres._ In faith, I will, la; never trust me else.[2217]

    _Dio._ Give me some token for the surety of it.

    _Cres._ I'll fetch you one.                              [_Exit_  60

    _Ulyss._ You have sworn patience.

    _Tro._                             Fear me not, sweet lord;[2218]
    I will not be myself, nor have cognition
    Of what I feel: I am all patience.

                       _Re-enter_ CRESSIDA.[2219]

    _Ther._ Now the pledge; now, now, now![2220]

    _Cres._ Here, Diomed, keep this sleeve.                           65

    _Tro._ O beauty! where is thy faith?

    _Ulyss._                              My lord,--

    _Tro._ I will be patient; outwardly I will.[2221]

    _Cres._ You look upon that sleeve; behold it well.[2222]
    He loved me--O false wench!--Give't me again.

    _Dio._ Whose was't?                                               70

    _Cres._ It is no matter, now I have't again.[2223]
    I will not meet with you to-morrow night:
    I prithee, Diomed, visit me no more.

    _Ther._ Now she sharpens: well said, whetstone!

    _Dio._ I shall have it.[2224]

    _Cres._                  What, this?

    _Dio._                               Ay, that.                    75

    _Cres._ O, all you gods! O pretty, pretty pledge!
    Thy master now lies thinking in his bed[2225]
    Of thee and me, and sighs, and takes my glove,
    And gives memorial dainty kisses to it,[2226]
    As I kiss thee. Nay, do not snatch it from me;[2226][2227]        80
    He that takes that doth take my heart withal.[2228]

    _Dio._ I had your heart before; this follows it.

    _Tro._ I did swear patience.

    _Cres._ You shall not have it, Diomed; faith, you shall not;[2229]
    I'll give you something else.                                     85

    _Dio._ I will have this: whose was it?

    _Cres._                                It is no matter.[2230]

    _Dio._ Come, tell me whose it was.

    _Cres._ 'Twas one's that loved me better than you will.[2231]
    But, now you have it, take it.

    _Dio._                         Whose was it?[2232]

    _Cres._ By all Diana's waiting-women yond,[2233]                  90
    And by herself, I will not tell you whose.

    _Dio._ To-morrow will I wear it on my helm,
    And grieve his spirit that dares not challenge it.

    _Tro._ Wert thou the devil, and worest it on thy horn,
    It should be challenged.                                          95

    _Cres._ Well, well, 'tis done, 'tis past; and yet it is not;
    I will not keep my word.

    _Dio._                   Why then, farewell;[2234]
    Thou never shalt mock Diomed again.[2234]

    _Cres._ You shall not go: one cannot speak a word,[2234][2235]
    But it straight starts you.[2234]

    _Dio._                      I do not like this fooling.[2234]    100

    _Ther._ Nor I, by Pluto: but that that likes not you[2236][2237]
    Pleases me best.[2236]

    _Dio._           What, shall I come? the hour?

    _Cres._ Ay, come: O Jove! do come: I shall be plagued.

    _Dio._ Farewell till then.

    _Cres._                          Good night: I prithee, come.

                                                 [_Exit Diomedes._[2238]

    Troilus, farewell! one eye yet looks on thee,                    105
    But with my heart the other eye doth see.[2239]
    Ah, poor our sex! this fault in us I find,
    The error of our eye directs our mind:
    What error leads must err; O, then conclude
    Minds sway'd by eyes are full of turpitude.            [_Exit._  110

    _Ther._ A proof of strength she could not publish more,[2240]
    Unless she said 'My mind is now turn'd whore.'[2241]

    _Ulyss._ All's done, my lord.

    _Tro._                        It is.

    _Ulyss._                             Why stay we then?

    _Tro._ To make a recordation to my soul
    Of every syllable that here was spoke.                           115
    But if I tell how these two did co-act,[2242]
    Shall I not lie in publishing a truth?
    Sith yet there is a credence in my heart,
    An esperance so obstinately strong,
    That doth invert the attest of eyes and ears;[2243]              120
    As if those organs had deceptious functions,[2244]
    Created only to calumniate.[2245]
    Was Cressid here?[2245]

    _Ulyss._          I cannot conjure, Trojan.

    _Tro._ She was not, sure.

    _Ulyss._                  Most sure she was.[2246]

    _Tro._ Why, my negation hath no taste of madness.[2247]          125

    _Ulyss._ Nor mine, my lord: Cressid was here but now.

    _Tro._ Let it not be believed for womanhood!
    Think, we had mothers; do not give advantage
    To stubborn critics, apt without a theme
    For depravation, to square the general sex[2248]                 130
    By Cressid's rule: rather think this not Cressid.

    _Ulyss._ What hath she done, prince, that can soil our mothers?[2249]

    _Tro._ Nothing at all, unless that this were she.

    _Ther._ Will a'swagger himself out on's own eyes?[2250]

    _Tro._ This she? no, this is Diomed's Cressida:[2251]            135
    If beauty have a soul, this is not she;
    If souls guide vows, if vows be sanctimonies,[2252]
    If sanctimony be the gods' delight,
    If there be rule in unity itself,[2253]
    This is not she. O madness of discourse,[2254]                   140
    That cause sets up with and against itself![2255]
    Bi-fold authority! where reason can revolt[2256][2257]
    Without perdition, and loss assume all reason[2257][2258]
    Without revolt: this is, and is not, Cressid!
    Within my soul there doth conduce a fight[2259]                  145
    Of this strange nature, that a thing inseparate
    Divides more wider than the sky and earth;[2260]
    And yet the spacious breadth of this division
    Admits no orifex for a point as subtle[2261][2262]
    As Ariachne's broken woof to enter.[2261][2263]                  150
    Instance, O instance! strong as Pluto's gates;
    Cressid is mine, tied with the bonds of heaven:
    Instance, O instance! strong as heaven itself;
    The bonds of heaven are slipp'd, dissolved and loosed;
    And with another knot, five-finger-tied,[2264]                   155
    The fractions of her faith, orts of her love,
    The fragments, scraps, the bits and greasy relics
    Of her o'er-eaten faith, are bound to Diomed.[2265]

    _Ulyss._ May worthy Troilus be half attach'd[2266]
    With that which here his passion doth express?                   160

    _Tro._ Ay, Greek; and that shall be divulged well
    In characters as red as Mars his heart
    Inflamed with Venus: never did young man fancy[2267]
    With so eternal and so fix'd a soul.
    Hark, Greek: as much as I do Cressid love,[2268]                 165
    So much by weight hate I her Diomed:
    That sleeve is mine that he'll bear on his helm:[2269]
    Were it a casque composed by Vulcan's skill,
    My sword should bite it: not the dreadful spout
    Which shipmen do the hurricano call,                             170
    Constringed in mass by the almighty sun,[2270]
    Shall dizzy with more clamour Neptune's ear[2271]
    In his descent, than shall my prompted sword[2271]
    Falling on Diomed.[2271]

    _Ther._ He'll tickle it for his concupy.[2272]                   175

    _Tro._ O Cressid! O false Cressid! false, false, false!
    Let all untruths stand by thy stained name,
    And they'll seem glorious.

    _Ulyss._                   O, contain yourself;
    Your passion draws ears hither.

                             _Enter_ ÆNEAS.

    _Æne._ I have been seeking you this hour, my lord:               180
    Hector by this is arming him in Troy;
    Ajax your guard stays to conduct you home.[2273]

    _Tro._ Have with you, prince. My courteous lord, adieu.
    Farewell, revolted fair! and, Diomed,
    Stand fast, and wear a castle on thy head!                       185

    _Ulyss._ I'll bring you to the gates.

    _Tro._ Accept distracted thanks.

                                 [_Exeunt Troilus, Æneas, and Ulysses._

    _Ther._ Would I could meet that rogue Diomed! I would
    croak like a raven; I would bode, I would bode. Patroclus
    will give me any thing for the intelligence of this whore: the   190
    parrot will not do more for an almond than he for a commodious
    drab. Lechery, lechery! still wars and lechery! nothing
    else holds fashion. A burning devil take them!              [_Exit._


SCENE III. _Troy. Before Priam's palace._[2274]

                    _Enter_ HECTOR _and_ ANDROMACHE.

    _And._ When was my lord so much ungently temper'd,
    To stop his ears against admonishment?
    Unarm, unarm, and do not fight to-day.

    _Hect._ You train me to offend you; get you in:[2275]
    By all the everlasting gods, I'll go![2276]                        5

    _And._ My dreams will, sure, prove ominous to the day.[2277]

    _Hect._ No more, I say.

                           _Enter_ CASSANDRA.

    _Cas._                  Where is my brother Hector?

    _And._ Here, sister; arm'd, and bloody in intent.
    Consort with me in loud and dear petition;[2278]
    Pursue we him on knees; for I have dream'd                        10
    Of bloody turbulence, and this whole night
    Hath nothing been but shapes and forms of slaughter.[2279]

    _Cas._ O, 'tis true.

    _Hect._              Ho! bid my trumpet sound!

    _Cas._ No notes of sally, for the heavens, sweet brother.[2280]

    _Hect._ Be gone, I say: the gods have heard me swear.             15

    _Cas._ The gods are deaf to hot and peevish vows:
    They are polluted offerings, more abhorr'd
    Than spotted livers in the sacrifice.

    _And._ O, be persuaded! do not count it holy[2281][2282][2283]
    To hurt by being just: it is as lawful,[2281][2283][2284][2285][2286]  20
    For we would give much, to use violent thefts[2281][2283][2284][2286]
    And rob in the behalf of charity.[2283][2284]

    _Cas._ It is the purpose that makes strong the vow;[2287]
    But vows to every purpose must not hold:
    Unarm, sweet Hector.[2288]

    _Hect._              Hold you still, I say;                       25
    Mine honour keeps the weather of my fate:[2289]
    Life every man holds dear; but the dear man[2290]
    Holds honour far more precious-dear than life.[2291]

                            _Enter_ TROILUS.

    How now, young man! mean'st thou to fight to-day?[2292]

    _And._ Cassandra, call my father to persuade.                     30

                                                      [_Exit Cassandra._

    _Hect._ No, faith, young Troilus; doff thy harness, youth:
    I am to-day i' the vein of chivalry:
    Let grow thy sinews till their knots be strong,[2293]
    And tempt not yet the brushes of the war.[2294]
    Unarm thee, go; and doubt thou not, brave boy,                    35
    I'll stand to-day for thee and me and Troy.

    _Tro._ Brother, you have a vice of mercy in you,
    Which better fits a lion than a man.

    _Hect._ What vice is that, good Troilus? chide me for it.[2295]

    _Tro._ When many times the captive Grecian falls,[2296]           40
    Even in the fan and wind of your fair sword,[2297]
    You bid them rise and live.[2298]

    _Hect._ O, 'tis fair play.

    _Tro._                     Fool's play, by heaven, Hector.

    _Hect._ How now! how now!

    _Tro._                    For the love of all the gods,[2299]
    Let's leave the hermit pity with our mother;[2300]                45
    And when we have our armours buckled on,
    The venom'd vengeance ride upon our swords,[2301]
    Spur them to ruthful work, rein them from ruth![2302]

    _Hect._ Fie, savage, fie!

    _Tro._                     Hector, then 'tis wars.[2303]

    _Hect._ Troilus, I would not have you fight to-day.               50

    _Tro._ Who should withhold me?[2304]
    Not fate, obedience, nor the hand of Mars
    Beckoning with fiery truncheon my retire;
    Not Priamus and Hecuba on knees,
    Their eyes o'ergalled with recourse of tears;                     55
    Nor you, my brother, with your true sword drawn,
    Opposed to hinder me, should stop my way,
    But by my ruin.

               _Re-enter_ CASSANDRA, _with_ PRIAM.[2305]

    _Cas._ Lay hold upon him, Priam, hold him fast:[2306]
    He is thy crutch; now if thou lose thy stay,                      60
    Thou on him leaning, and all Troy on thee,
    Fall all together.

    _Pri._             Come, Hector, come, go back:[2307]
    Thy wife hath dream'd; thy mother hath had visions;
    Cassandra doth foresee; and I myself
    Am like a prophet suddenly enrapt,                                65
    To tell thee that this day is ominous:
    Therefore, come back.

    _Hect._               Æneas is afield;[2308]
    And I do stand engaged to many Greeks,
    Even in the faith of valour, to appear
    This morning to them.

    _Pri._                Ay, but thou shalt not go.[2309]            70

    _Hect._ I must not break my faith.
    You know me dutiful; therefore, dear sir,
    Let me not shame respect; but give me leave
    To take that course by your consent and voice,
    Which you do here forbid me, royal Priam.                         75

    _Cas._ O Priam, yield not to him!

    _And._                            Do not, dear father.

    _Hect._ Andromache, I am offended with you:
    Upon the love you bear me, get you in.           [_Exit Andromache._

    _Tro._ This foolish, dreaming, superstitious girl
    Makes all these bodements.

    _Cas._                     O, farewell, dear Hector!              80
    Look, how thou diest! look, how thy eye turns pale![2310]
    Look, how thy wounds do bleed at many vents![2311]
    Hark, how Troy roars! how Hecuba cries out![2312]
    How poor Andromache shrills her dolours forth![2313]
    Behold, distraction, frenzy and amazement,[2314]                  85
    Like witless antics, one another meet,
    And all cry 'Hector! Hector's dead! O Hector!'

    _Tro._ Away! away![2315]

    _Cas._ Farewell: yet, soft! Hector, I take my leave:[2316]
    Thou dost thyself and all our Troy deceive.             [_Exit._  90

    _Hect._ You are amazed, my liege, at her exclaim:
    Go in and cheer the town: we'll forth and fight,[2317]
    Do deeds worth praise and tell you them at night.[2318]

    _Pri._ Farewell: the gods with safety stand about thee!

                     [_Exeunt severally Priam and Hector. Alarum._[2319]

    _Tro._ They are at it, hark! Proud Diomed, believe,[2320]         95
    I come to lose my arm, or win my sleeve.

                        _Enter_ PANDARUS.[2321]

    _Pan._ Do you hear, my lord? do you hear?[2322][2323]

    _Tro._ What now?[2322]

    _Pan._ Here's a letter come from yond poor girl.[2322]

    _Tro._ Let me read.[2322][2324]                                  100

    _Pan._ A whoreson tisick, a whoreson rascally tisick so[2322][2325]
    troubles me, and the foolish fortune of this girl; and what[2322]
    one thing, what another, that I shall leave you one o' these[2322][2326]
    days: and I have a rheum in mine eyes too, and such an[2322]
    ache in my bones that, unless a man were cursed, I cannot[2322]  105
    tell what to think on't. What says she there?[2322]

    _Tro._ Words, words, mere words, no matter from the heart;[2322]
    The effect doth operate another way. [_Tearing the letter._[2322][2327]
    Go, wind, to wind, there turn and change together.[2322]
    My love with words and errors still she feeds,[2322][2328]       110
    But edifies another with her deeds. [_Exeunt severally._[2322][2329]


SCENE IV. _The field between Troy and the Grecian camp._

             _Alarums. Excursions. Enter_ THERSITES.[2330]

    _Ther._ Now they are clapper-clawing one another; I'll go
    look on. That dissembling abominable varlet, Diomed, has
    got that same scurvy doting foolish young knave's sleeve of[2331][2332]
    Troy there in his helm: I would fain see them meet; that[2332]
    that same young Trojan ass, that loves the whore there,            5
    might send that Greekish whoremasterly villain, with the
    sleeve, back to the dissembling luxurious drab, of a sleeveless
    errand. O' the t'other side, the policy of those crafty[2333]
    swearing rascals, that stale old mouse-eaten dry cheese,[2334]
    Nestor, and that same dog-fox, Ulysses, is not proved worth[2335]  10
    a blackberry. They set me up in policy that mongrel
    cur, Ajax, against that dog of as bad a kind, Achilles: and
    now is the cur Ajax prouder than the cur Achilles, and will
    not arm to-day; whereupon the Grecians begin to proclaim[2336]
    barbarism, and policy grows into an ill opinion.                  15

                 _Enter_ DIOMEDES _and_ TROILUS.[2337]

    Soft! here comes sleeve, and t'other.[2338]

    _Tro._ Fly not; for shouldst thou take the river Styx,[2339]
    I would swim after.[2339]

    _Dio._              Thou dost miscall retire:
    I do not fly; but advantageous care
    Withdrew me from the odds of multitude:[2340]                     20
    Have at thee![2340]

    _Ther._ Hold thy whore, Grecian! Now for thy whore,
    Trojan! Now the sleeve, now the sleeve!

                         [_Exeunt Troilus and Diomedes, fighting._[2341]

                            _Enter_ HECTOR.

    _Hect._ What art thou, Greek? art thou for Hector's match?[2342]
    Art thou of blood and honour?                                     25

    _Ther._ No, no: I am a rascal; a scurvy railing knave;[2343]
    a very filthy rogue.[2343]

    _Hect._ I do believe thee. Live.                      [_Exit._[2344]

    _Ther._ God-a-mercy, that thou wilt believe me; but a
    plague break thy neck for frighting me! What's become of[2345]    30
    the wenching rogues? I think they have swallowed one
    another: I would laugh at that miracle: yet in a sort
    lechery eats itself. I'll seek them.                        [_Exit._


SCENE V. _Another part of the field._

                 _Enter_ DIOMEDES _and_ Servant.[2346]

    _Dio._ Go, go, my servant, take thou Troilus' horse;[2347]
    Present the fair steed to my lady Cressid:
    Fellow, commend my service to her beauty;
    Tell her I have chastised the amorous Trojan,
    And am her knight by proof.

    _Ser._                      I go, my lord.               [_Exit._  5

                        _Enter_ AGAMEMNON.[2348]

    _Agam._ Renew, renew! The fierce Polydamas[2349]
    Hath beat down Menon: bastard Margarelon
    Hath Doreus prisoner,[2350]
    And stands colossus-wise, waving his beam,
    Upon the pashed corses of the kings[2351]                         10
    Epistrophus and Cedius: Polyxenes is slain;[2352]
    Amphimachus and Thoas deadly hurt;[2353]
    Patroclus ta'en or slain; and Palamedes
    Sore hurt and bruised: the dreadful sagittary[2354]
    Appals our numbers: haste we, Diomed,                             15
    To reinforcement, or we perish all.

                            _Enter_ NESTOR.

    _Nest._ Go, bear Patroclus' body to Achilles,[2355]
    And bid the snail-paced Ajax arm for shame.
    There is a thousand Hectors in the field:[2356]
    Now here he fights on Galathe his horse,                          20
    And there lacks work; anon he's there afoot,
    And there they fly or die, like scaled sculls[2357]
    Before the belching whale; then is he yonder,
    And there the strawy Greeks, ripe for his edge,[2358]
    Fall down before him, like the mower's swath:[2359]               25
    Here, there and every where he leaves and takes,[2360]
    Dexterity so obeying appetite
    That what he will he does, and does so much[2361]
    That proof is call'd impossibility.

                            _Enter_ ULYSSES.

    _Ulyss._ O, courage, courage, princes! great Achilles             30
    Is arming, weeping, cursing, vowing vengeance:
    Patroclus' wounds have roused his drowsy blood,[2355]
    Together with his mangled Myrmidons,
    That noseless, handless, hack'd and chipp'd, come to him,
    Crying on Hector. Ajax hath lost a friend,                        35
    And foams at mouth, and he is arm'd, and at it,
    Roaring for Troilus; who hath done to-day
    Mad and fantastic execution,
    Engaging and redeeming of himself,
    With such a careless force and forceless care,                    40
    As if that luck, in very spite of cunning,[2362][2363]
    Bade him win all.[2362]

                             _Enter_ AJAX.

    _Ajax._ Troilus! thou coward Troilus!                 [_Exit._[2364]

    _Dio._                                Ay, there, there.

    _Nest._ So, so, we draw together.[2365]

                           _Enter_ ACHILLES.

    _Achil._                          Where is this Hector?
    Come, come, thou boy-queller, show thy face;[2366]                45
    Know what it is to meet Achilles angry:
    Hector! where's Hector? I will none but Hector.     [_Exeunt._[2367]


SCENE VI. _Another part of the field._[2368]

                             _Enter_ AJAX.

    _Ajax._ Troilus, thou coward Troilus, show thy head![2369]

                           _Enter_ DIOMEDES.

    _Dio._ Troilus, I say! where's Troilus?[2370]

    _Ajax._                             What wouldst thou?

    _Dio._ I would correct him.

    _Ajax._ Were I the general, thou shouldst have my office[2371]
    Ere that correction. Troilus, I say! what, Troilus!                5

                            _Enter_ TROILUS.

    _Tro._ O traitor Diomed! Turn thy false face, thou traitor.
    And pay thy life thou owest me for my horse.[2372]

    _Dio._ Ha, art thou there?

    _Ajax._ I'll fight with him alone: stand, Diomed.

    _Dio._ He is my prize; I will not look upon.[2373]                10

    _Tro._ Come both, you cogging Greeks; have at you
              both!                                 [_Exeunt, fighting._

                         _Enter_ HECTOR.[2374]

    _Hect._ Yea, Troilus? O, well fought, my youngest brother!

                           _Enter_ ACHILLES.

    _Achil._ Now do I see thee; ha! have at thee, Hector![2375]

    _Hect._ Pause, if thou wilt.[2376]

    _Achil._ I do disdain thy courtesy, proud Trojan:                 15
    Be happy that my arms are out of use:
    My rest and negligence befriends thee now,[2377]
    But thou anon shalt hear of me again;[2378]
    Till when, go seek thy fortune.                       [_Exit._[2379]

    _Hect._                         Fare thee well:
    I would have been much more a fresher man,[2380]                  20
    Had I expected thee.

                       _Re-enter_ TROILUS.[2381]

                         How now, my brother!

    _Tro._ Ajax hath ta'en Æneas: shall it be?
    No, by the flame of yonder glorious heaven,
    He shall not carry him; I'll be ta'en too,[2382]
    Or bring him off. Fate, hear me what I say![2378]                 25
    I reck not though I end my life to-day.                     [_Exit._

                 _Enter one in sumptuous armour._[2383]

    _Hect._ Stand, stand, thou Greek; thou art a goodly mark.[2384]
    No? wilt thou not? I like thy armour well;[2385]
    I'll frush it, and unlock the rivets all,[2386]
    But I'll be master of it. Wilt thou not, beast, abide?            30
    Why then, fly on, I'll hunt thee for thy hide.      [_Exeunt._[2387]


SCENE VII. _Another part of the field._[2388]

                  _Enter_ ACHILLES, _with_ Myrmidons.

    _Achil._ Come here about me, you my Myrmidons;
    Mark what I say. Attend me where I wheel:
    Strike not a stroke, but keep yourselves in breath:
    And when I have the bloody Hector found,
    Empale him with your weapons round about;                          5
    In fellest manner execute your aims.[2389]
    Follow me, sirs, and my proceedings eye:[2390]
    It is decreed Hector the great must die.                  [_Exeunt._

    _Enter_ MENELAUS _and_ PARIS, _fighting: then_ THERSITES.[2391]

    _Ther._ The cuckold and the cuckold-maker are at it.[2392]
    Now, bull! now, dog! 'Loo, Paris, 'loo! now my[2393][2394]  10
    double-henned sparrow! 'loo, Paris, 'loo! The bull has the game:[2393][2395]
    ware horns, ho!                        [_Exeunt Paris and Menelaus._

                       _Enter_ MARGARELON.[2396]

    _Mar._ Turn, slave, and fight.[2397]

    _Ther._ What art thou?

    _Mar._ A bastard son of Priam's.[2397]                            15

    _Ther._ I am a bastard too; I love bastards: I am a bastard[2398]
    begot, bastard instructed, bastard in mind, bastard in[2398]
    valour, in every thing illegitimate. One bear will not bite
    another, and wherefore should one bastard? Take heed,
    the quarrel's most ominous to us: if the son of a whore fight[2399]  20
    for a whore, he tempts judgement: farewell, bastard.  [_Exit._[2400]

    _Mar._ The devil take thee, coward!             [_Exit._[2397][2401]


SCENE VIII. _Another part of the field._[2402]

                            _Enter_ HECTOR.

    _Hect._ Most putrefied core, so fair without,
    Thy goodly armour thus hath cost thy life.
    Now is my day's work done; I'll take good breath:[2403]
    Rest, sword; thou hast thy fill of blood and death.

                 [_Puts off his helmet and hangs his shield behind him._

                _Enter_ ACHILLES _and_ Myrmidons.[2404]

    _Achil._ Look, Hector, how the sun begins to set;[2405]            5
    How ugly night comes breathing at his heels:
    Even with the vail and darking of the sun,[2406]
    To close the day up, Hector's life is done.[2407]

    _Hect._ I am unarm'd; forego this vantage, Greek.

    _Achil._ Strike, fellows, strike; this is the man I seek.  10

                                             [_Hector falls._[2408]

    So, Ilion, fall thou next! now, Troy, sink down![2409]
    Here lies thy heart, thy sinews, and thy bone.
    On, Myrmidons; and cry you all amain,[2410]
    'Achilles hath the mighty Hector slain.' [_A retreat sounded._[2411]
    Hark! a retire upon our Grecian part.[2412]                       15

    _Myr._ The Trojan trumpets sound the like, my lord.[2413]

    _Achil._ The dragon wing of night o'erspreads the earth,
    And stickler-like the armies separates.[2414]
    My half-supp'd sword that frankly would have fed,[2415]
    Pleased with this dainty bait, thus goes to bed.  20

                                 [_Sheathes his sword._[2415][2416]

    Come, tie his body to my horse's tail;
    Along the field I will the Trojan trail.

                                    [_Exeunt. A retreat sounded._[2417]


SCENE IX. _Another part of the field._

       _Enter_ AGAMEMNON, AJAX, MENELAUS, NESTOR, DIOMEDES, _and
               the rest, marching. Shouts within._[2418]

    _Agam._ Hark! hark! what shout is that?[2419][2420]

    _Nest._ Peace, drums![2419]

    [_Within_] 'Achilles! Achilles! Hector's slain! Achilles!'[2419][2421]

    _Dio._ The bruit is, Hector's slain, and by Achilles.[2422]

    _Ajax._ If it be so, yet bragless let it be;                       5
    Great Hector was a man as good as he.[2423]

    _Agam._ March patiently along: let one be sent[2424]
    To pray Achilles see us at our tent.
    If in his death the gods have us befriended,
    Great Troy is ours, and our sharp wars are ended.       10

                                             [_Exeunt, marching._[2425]


SCENE X. _Another part of the field._

         _Enter_ ÆNEAS, PARIS, ANTENOR, _and_ DEIPHOBUS.[2426]

    _Æne._ Stand, ho! yet are we masters of the field:
    Never go home; here starve we out the night.[2427]

                            _Enter_ TROILUS.

    _Tro._ Hector is slain.[2427]

    _All._                  Hector! The gods forbid!

    _Tro._ He's dead; and at the murderer's horse's tail
    In beastly sort dragg'd through the shameful field.                5
    Frown on, you heavens, effect your rage with speed!
    Sit, gods, upon your thrones, and smile at Troy![2428]
    I say, at once let your brief plagues be mercy,[2428]
    And linger not our sure destructions on!

    _Æne._ My lord, you do discomfort all the host.                   10

    _Tro._ You understand me not that tell me so:
    I do not speak of flight, of fear, of death,[2429]
    But dare all imminence that gods and men
    Address their dangers in. Hector is gone:
    Who shall tell Priam so, or Hecuba?                               15
    Let him that will a screech-owl aye be call'd,[2430]
    Go in to Troy, and say there 'Hector's dead:'[2431]
    There is a word will Priam turn to stone,
    Make wells and Niobes of the maids and wives,[2432]
    Cold statues of the youth, and, in a word,[2433]                  20
    Scare Troy out of itself. But march away:[2434][2435]
    Hector is dead; there is no more to say.[2435]
    Stay yet. You vile abominable tents,[2436]
    Thus proudly pight upon our Phrygian plains,[2437]
    Let Titan rise as early as he dare,                               25
    I'll through and through you! and, thou great-sized coward,
    No space of earth shall sunder our two hates:
    I'll haunt thee like a wicked conscience still,
    That mouldeth goblins swift as frenzy's thoughts.[2438]
    Strike a free march to Troy! with comfort go:[2439]               30
    Hope of revenge shall hide our inward woe.

                                            [_Exeunt Æneas and Trojans._

_As_ TROILUS _is going out, enter, from the other side_, PANDARUS.[2440]

    _Pan._ But hear you, hear you![2441]

    _Tro._ Hence, broker-lackey! ignomy and shame[2442]
    Pursue thy life, and live aye with thy name!          [_Exit._[2443]

    _Pan._ A goodly medicine for my aching bones![2444]               35
    O world! world! world! thus is the poor agent despised! O[2445]
    traitors and bawds, how earnestly are you set a-work, and[2446]
    how ill requited! why should our endeavour be so loved[2447]
    and the performance so loathed? what verse for it? what
    instance for it? Let me see:                                      40

            Full merrily the humble-bee doth sing,
            Till he hath lost his honey and his sting;
            And being once subdued in armed tail,[2448]
            Sweet honey and sweet notes together fail.

    Good traders in the flesh, set this in your painted cloths:[2449]  45
    As many as be here of Pandar's hall,
    Your eyes, half out, weep out at Pandar's fall;[2450]
    Or if you cannot weep, yet give some groans,
    Though not for me, yet for your aching bones.[2451]
    Brethren and sisters of the hold-door trade,[2452]                50
    Some two months hence my will shall here be made:
    It should be now, but that my fear is this,
    Some galled goose of Winchester would hiss:
    Till then I'll sweat and seek about for eases,[2453]
    And at that time bequeath you my diseases.        [_Exit._[2454]  55

NOTES.


NOTE I.

The Folios have 'The Tragedy of Troylus and Cressida' as title of the
play. In the first three the prologue precedes the title. In the fourth
the order is reversed. In the third and fourth 'Troylus' is spelt
'Troilus,' both here and in the body of the play. Some copies of the
Quarto have 'The Famous Historie of Troylus and Cresseid,' others 'The
Historie of Troylus and Cresseida,' as first title, while the running
title in all is, 'The History of Troylus and Cresseida.' The play is
not divided into Acts and Scenes either in the Quarto or the Folios,
excepting that the latter have _Actus Primus, Scæna Prima_, at the
beginning.

In the spelling of 'Trojan' we have conformed to modern usage. In the
Quarto it is uniformly 'Troyan' and usually 'Troian' in the first Folio.


NOTE II.

I. 3. 238. The reading of the Quarto given in the note at the foot of
the page is that of Capell's copy, in which the final 's' of 'swords'
has failed to take the ink. In the Duke of Devonshire's copy the 's' is
visible but imperfect.


NOTE III.

I. 3. 357-365. The Quarto reads as follows:

    'Giue pardon to my speech? therefore tis meete,
    _Achilles_ meete not _Hector_, let vs like Marchants
    First shew foule wares, and thinke perchance theile sell;
    If not; the luster of the better shall exceed,
    By shewing the worse first: do not consent,
    That euer _Hector_ and _Achilles_ meet,
    For both our honour and our shame in this, are dog'd with
    two strange followers.'

Capell adopts the Quarto reading, putting 'If not' in a line by itself.


NOTE IV.

II. 2. 22. This misprint of Theobald's was repeated in every edition,
except those of Hanmer and Capell, down to that of Harness, 1825,
inclusive. Mr Knight made the necessary correction. We have left
unnoticed many similar instances.


NOTE V.

II. 3. 74. Mr Dyce suggests that the reading 'sate' of the Quarto was a
mistake for 'rates.'


NOTE VI.

II. 3. 130-133. Both the Quarto and the Folios put a full stop at
_report_, a colon at _war_, and a full stop or colon at _giant_: a
punctuation which was followed substantially by Rowe and Pope. Theobald
first put a comma at _report_ and inverted commas before _Bring_,
forgetting, however, to mark the end of the quotation. Hanmer printed
the line _Bring ... war_ in italics, and Johnson put the whole passage
_Bring ... giant_ in inverted commas. Subsequent editors have followed
him in marking the quotation thus. We have done the like, though with
some doubt as to whether Hanmer's view be not preferable.


NOTE VII.

II. 3. 187, sqq. Rowe, in this passage, followed the Folios. Pope, too,
left the preposterously long line '(As amply titled, as Achilles is,)
by going to Achilles:' but in the following, altered 'fat already,
pride' to 'pride, already fat.' Theobald followed Pope.

Hanmer reads:

    'As amply titled as Achilles' is,
    By going to Achilles: for that were
    But to inlard his pride, already fat.'

Johnson first adopted the reading and arrangement given in the
text, followed by Capell, except that the latter gave, like Hanmer,
_Achilles'_ (with an apostrophe) in the first line.


NOTE VIII.

III. 2. 21. Capell's copy of the Quarto has distinctly 'repured,'
though Capell, usually so accurate in his collation, omitted to notice
that it differed from the Folio. The same is the reading of the copy
in the Duke of Devonshire's Library, and of two copies in the British
Museum, one of which formerly belonged to Steevens.

Steevens's reprint has 'reputed'--an error which seems to have been
the source of the statement that some copies of the Quarto have that
reading.


NOTE IX.

III. 3. 120. In Capell's copy of the Quarto there are traces of what
appeared to us at first to be an imperfect letter at the end of the
word 'reuerb'rate.' On referring, however, to the Duke of Devonshire's
copy, and to the two in the British Museum, we are inclined to believe
that the apparently imperfect letter is in reality a lead.


NOTE X.

III. 3. 123-128. The Quarto has,

                      'I was much rap't in this,
    And apprehended here immediately,
    Th' vnknowne _Aiax_, heauens what a man is there?
    A very horse, that has he knowes not what
    Nature what things there are.
    Most obiect in regard, and deere in vse,' &c.

The first Folio gives,

                      'I was much rapt in this,
    And apprehended here immediately:
    The vnknowne _Aiax_;
    Heauens what a man is there? a very Horse,
    That has he knowes not what. Nature, what things there are.
    Most abiect in regard, and deare in vse.'

The later Folios omitted the stop between 'what' and 'Nature,' which
misled Rowe, who in his first edition read:

    'That as he knows not Nature, what things are' &c.

Pope read,

                    'I was much rapt in this,
    And apprehended here immediately
    The unknown _Ajax_----
    Heav'ns! what a man is there? a very horse,
    He knows not his own nature: what things are
    Most abject in regard, and dear in use?'

Hanmer reconstructed the whole passage, thus:

                        'I was much rapt
    In this I read, and apprehended here
    Immediately the unknown _Ajax_: heavens!
    What a man's there? a very horse, that has
    He knows not what: in nature what things there are
    Most abject in regard, and dear in use.'


NOTE XI.

IV. 4. 74-77. The Quarto here reads:

                  'Here why I speake it loue,
    The Grecian youths are full of quality,
    And swelling ore with arts and exercise:'

The first Folio has:

                  'Heare why I speake it; Loue:
    The Grecian youths are full of qualitie,
    Their louing well compos'd, with guift of nature,
    Flawing and swelling ore with Arts and exercise:'

The second Folio has the same except that it substitutes 'Flowing' for
'Flawing.' The third and fourth have substantially the same reading as
the second.

Rowe edited it thus:

    'Hear while I speak it, Love:
    The _Grecian_ Youths are full of subtle Qualities,
    They're loving, well compos'd, with gift of Nature,
    Flowing and swelling o'er with Arts and Exercise;'

Pope followed Rowe, with a difference of punctuation:

                    '... with gift of Nature
    Flowing,' &c.

Theobald followed Pope, except that he restored 'why' for 'while' in
the first line, and Warburton Theobald, reading 'gifts' for 'gift.'

Johnson followed Warburton, except that in place of 'qualities' he
restored 'quality.'

Hanmer has:

    'Hear why I speak it, love: the _Grecian_ youths
    Are full of subtle qualities, they're loving,
    They're well compos'd, with gifts of nature flowing,
    And swelling o'er with arts and exercise.'

Capell thus:

    'Hear why I speak it, love: The Grecian youths
    Are well compos'd, with gifts of nature flowing,
    And swelling o'er with arts and exercise:'

Malone reads:

                  'Hear why I speak it, love;
    The Grecian youths are full of quality;
    They're loving, well compos'd, with gifts of nature flowing,
    And swelling o'er with arts and exercise;'

Mr Knight and Mr Collier give the reading of the second and following
Folios, only striking out the comma after 'compos'd.'

Mr Grant White:

    'They're loving, well compos'd with gifts of nature,
    Flowing and swelling o'er with arts and exercise.'

The reading which we have adopted in the text is that of Mr Staunton.
The word 'Flowing' was in all probability a marginal correction for
'swelling,' which the printer of the Folio by mistake added to the line.


NOTE XII.

IV. 5. 96. The Quarto reads:

    '_Vlis._ The yongest sonne of _Priam_, a true knight.'

The first Folio has:

    '_Vlis._ The youngest Sonne of _Priam_;
    A true Knight; they call him _Troylus_.'

The second Folio amended the metre of the second line by reading,

    'And a true Knight; they call him Troylus;'

which was followed in the later Folios and Rowe. Pope restored the
reading of the Quarto, which is probably the true one, as the words
'they call him Troilus' occur lower down in the speech, at line 108. If
they are retained at all, we should read,

    '_Ulys._ They call him Troilus:
    The youngest son of Priam, a true knight;'

but most likely they are the insertion of a hasty corrector.


NOTE XIII.

IV. 5. 103. Although we have not been able to find any other instance
of 'impair' as an adjective, we have retained it; for editors should be
careful not to obliterate ἅπαξ λεγόμενα, and etymologically 'impair'
may have the sense of 'unsuitable, unequal to the theme.' Johnson's
conjecture of 'impure,' though plausible, is not entirely satisfactory,
as it is Troilus's ripeness of judgement and not his modesty which is
the subject of praise.


NOTE XIV.

V. 2. 12. The short speeches throughout this scene are printed as verse
first by Steevens (1793). This arrangement has been generally adopted
by later editors. From the manner in which the short lines are arranged
in the earlier editions it is impossible to say whether they were
intended to be read as verse or not. An alteration made by Pope in line
40 for the sake of the metre shows that he read some of the lines at
least as verse.


NOTE XV.

V. 3. III. The Folio here inserts the following lines:

    '_Pand._ Why, but heare you?

    _Troy._ Hence brother lackie; ignomie and shame
    Pursue thy life, and liue aye with thy name.'

As they occur again, with a slight variation in the first line, in the
last scene, we have followed the Quarto in omitting them. This is an
indication that the play has been tampered with by another hand than
Shakespeare's.


NOTE XVI.

V. 7. 6. Mr Collier quotes the Duke of Devonshire's copy of the Quarto
as authority for the reading 'aims,' 'the letter i being a little
indistinct.' This is a mistake. The indistinct letter is, beyond all
question, an imperfect r. Capell's copy and the two copies in the
British Museum all have 'armes.' In the same note Mr Collier quotes the
Folio as reading 'arm,' not 'arme,' and attributes Capell's correction
to Steevens.


NOTE XVII.

V. 10. 31. Here Capell inserts the passage '_Pan._ Do you hear ...
deeds,' V. 3. 97-111, and after Troilus's speech, 'What now?' gives the
stage direction 'Exeunt Æneas, and Trojans.'

ACT I.


SCENE I. _Rome. A street._[2455]

 _Enter a company of mutinous_ Citizens, _with staves, clubs, and other
                               weapons_.

    _First Cit._ Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.

    _All._ Speak, speak.[2456]

    _First Cit._ You are all resolved rather to die than to
    famish?

    _All._ Resolved, resolved.                                         5

    _First Cit._ First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy[2457]
    to the people.

    _All._ We know't, we know't.[2458]

    _First Cit._ Let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our
    own price. Is't a verdict?                                        10

    _All._ No more talking on't; let it be done: away,[2459]
    away!

    _Sec. Cit._ One word, good citizens.

    _First Cit._ We are accounted poor citizens; the patricians,
    good. What authority surfeits on would relieve us: if they[2460]  15
    would yield us but the superfluity while it were wholesome,
    we might guess they relieved us humanely; but they think[2461]
    we are too dear: the leanness that afflicts us, the object of[2462]
    our misery, is as an inventory to particularize their abundance;
    our sufferance is a gain to them. Let us revenge this[2463]       20
    with our pikes, ere we become rakes: for the gods know I[2464]
    speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge.

    _Sec. Cit._ Would you proceed especially against Caius
    Marcius?[2465]

    _All._ Against him first: he's a very dog to the[2466]            25
    commonalty.

    _Sec. Cit._ Consider you what services he has done for
    his country?

    _First Cit._ Very well; and could be content to give him
    good report for't, but that he pays himself with being proud.     30

    _Sec. Cit._ Nay, but speak not maliciously.[2467]

    _First Cit._ I say unto you, what he hath done famously,
    he did it to that end: though soft-conscienced men can be
    content to say it was for his country, he did it to please his[2468]
    mother and to be partly proud; which he is, even to the[2469]     35
    altitude of his virtue.

    _Sec. Cit._ What he cannot help in his nature, you account
    a vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.

    _First Cit._ If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations;
    he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition.              40
    [_Shouts within._] What shouts are these? The other side o'[2470][2471]
    the city is risen: why stay we prating here? to the Capitol!

    _All._ Come, come.

    _First Cit._ Soft! who comes here?

                    _Enter_ MENENIUS AGRIPPA.[2472]

    _Sec. Cit._ Worthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always[2473]   45
    loved the people.

    _First Cit._ He's one honest enough: would all the rest
    were so!

    _Men._ What work's, my countrymen, in hand? where go you[2474][2475]
    With bats and clubs? the matter? speak, I pray you.[2474][2476]   50

    _First Cit._ Our business is not unknown to the senate;[2477]
    they have had inkling, this fortnight, what we intend to do,[2478]
    which now we'll show 'em in deeds. They say poor suitors
    have strong breaths: they shall know we have strong arms
    too.                                                              55

    _Men._ Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours,[2479]
    Will you undo yourselves?[2479]

    _First Cit._ We cannot, sir, we are undone already.

    _Men._ I tell you, friends, most charitable care
    Have the patricians of you. For your wants,[2480]                 60
    Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well[2481]
    Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them[2482]
    Against the Roman state; whose course will on
    The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs
    Of more strong link asunder than can ever[2483]                   65
    Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,
    The gods, not the patricians, make it, and
    Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,
    You are transported by calamity
    Thither where more attends you, and you slander                   70
    The helms o' the state, who care for you like fathers,
    When you curse them as enemies.

    _First Cit._ Care for us! True, indeed! They ne'er[2484]
    cared for us yet: suffer us to famish, and their store-houses
    crammed with grain; make edicts for usury, to support             75
    usurers; repeal daily any wholesome act established against
    the rich, and provide more piercing statutes daily, to chain
    up and restrain the poor. If the wars eat us not up, they
    will; and there's all the love they bear us.

    _Men._ Either you must                                            80
    Confess yourselves wondrous malicious,
    Or be accused of folly. I shall tell you
    A pretty tale: it may be you have heard it;
    But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture
    To stale't a little more.[2485]                                   85

    _First Cit._ Well, I'll hear it, sir: yet you must not[2486][2487]
    think to fob off our disgrace with a tale: but, an't please[2486][2488]
    you, deliver.[2486]

    _Men._ There was a time when all the body's members
    Rebell'd against the belly; thus accused it:                      90
    That only like a gulf it did remain
    I' the midst o' the body, idle and unactive,[2489]
    Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing
    Like labour with the rest; where the other instruments
    Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,                   95
    And, mutually participate, did minister[2490]
    Unto the appetite and affection common
    Of the whole body. The belly answer'd--[2491][2492]

    _First Cit._ Well, sir, what answer made the belly?[2491]

    _Men._ Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,[2493]        100
    Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus--
    For, look you, I may make the belly smile
    As well as speak--it tauntingly replied[2494]
    To the discontented members, the mutinous parts
    That envied his receipt; even so most fitly                      105
    As you malign our senators for that
    They are not such as you.

    _First Cit._              Your belly's answer? What![2495]
    The kingly-crowned head, the vigilant eye,[2496][2497]
    The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,[2496]
    Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter,[2496]               110
    With other muniments and petty helps[2496]
    In this our fabric, if that they--[2496]

    _Men._                             What then?[2496][2498]
    'Fore me, this fellow speaks! what then? what then?[2496][2498][2499]

    _First Cit._ Should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd,[2496]
    Who is the sink o' the body,--[2496][2500]

    _Men._                         Well, what then?[2496]            115

    _First Cit._ The former agents, if they did complain,[2496][2501]
    What could the belly answer?[2496]

    _Men._                       I will tell you;
    If you'll bestow a small--of what you have little--[2502]
    Patience awhile, you'll hear the belly's answer.[2503]

    First Cit. You're long about it.[2504]

    _Men._                           Note me this, good friend:      120
    Your most grave belly was deliberate,
    Not rash like his accusers, and thus answer'd:
    'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he,
    'That I receive the general food at first,
    Which you do live upon; and fit it is,                           125
    Because I am the store-house and the shop
    Of the whole body: but, if you do remember,
    I send it through the rivers of your blood,
    Even to the court, the heart, to the seat o' the brain;[2505][2506]
    And, through the cranks and offices of man,[2506][2507]          130
    The strongest nerves and small inferior veins
    From me receive that natural competency
    Whereby they live: and though that all at once,
    You, my good friends,'--this says the belly, mark me,--[2508]

    _First Cit._ Ay, sir; well, well.

    _Men._                            'Though all at once cannot     135
    See what I do deliver out to each,
    Yet I can make my audit up, that all
    From me do back receive the flour of all,[2509]
    And leave me but the bran.' What say you to't?

    _First Cit._ It was an answer: how apply you this?[2510]         140

    _Men._ The senators of Rome are this good belly,
    And you the mutinous members: for examine[2511]
    Their counsels and their cares, digest things rightly[2511]
    Touching the weal o' the common, you shall find
    No public benefit which you receive                              145
    But it proceeds or comes from them to you
    And no way from yourselves. What do you think,
    You, the great toe of this assembly?

    _First Cit._ I the great toe! why the great toe?

    _Men._ For that, being one o' the lowest, basest, poorest,       150
    Of this most wise rebellion, thou go'st foremost:[2512]
    Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,[2513][2514]
    Lead'st first to win some vantage.[2513]
    But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs:
    Rome and her rats are at the point of battle;                    155
    The one side must have bale.[2515]

                         _Enter_ CAIUS MARCIUS.

                                 Hail, noble Marcius!

    _Mar._ Thanks. What's the matter, you dissentious rogues,
    That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,
    Make yourselves scabs?

    _First Cit._           We have ever your good word.

    _Mar._ He that will give good words to thee will flatter[2516]   160
    Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,[2517]
    That like nor peace nor war? the one affrights you,[2518]
    The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,[2519]
    Where he should find you lions, finds you hares,[2520]
    Where foxes, geese: you are no surer, no,[2521]                  165
    Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,
    Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is
    To make him worthy whose offence subdues him
    And curse that justice did it. Who deserves greatness[2522]
    Deserves your hate; and your affections are                      170
    A sick man's appetite, who desires most that
    Which would increase his evil. He that depends
    Upon your favours swims with fins of lead
    And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust ye?[2523]
    With every minute you do change a mind,[2524]                    175
    And call him noble that was now your hate,
    Him vile that was your garland. What's the matter,[2525]
    That in these several places of the city[2526]
    You cry against the noble senate, who,
    Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else                      180
    Would feed on one another? What's their seeking?

    _Men._ For corn at their own rates; whereof, they say.[2527]
    The city is well stored.

    _Mar._                   Hang 'em! They say!
    They'll sit by the fire, and presume to know
    What's done i' the Capitol; who's like to rise,                  185
    Who thrives and who declines; side factions and give out[2528]
    Conjectural marriages; making parties strong,
    And feebling such as stand not in their liking
    Below their cobbled shoes. They say there's grain enough![2529][2530]
    Would the nobility lay aside their ruth,[2529]                   190
    And let me use my sword, I'ld make a quarry[2529]
    With thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as high[2529]
    As I could pick my lance.[2529][2531]

    _Men._ Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;[2529][2532]
    For though abundantly they lack discretion,[2529]                195
    Yet are they passing cowardly. But, I beseech you,[2533]
    What says the other troop?

    _Mar._                     They are dissolved: hang 'em![2534]
    They said they were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs,
    That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,
    That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not            200
    Corn for the rich men only: with these shreds
    They vented their complainings; which being answer'd,
    And a petition granted them, a strange one--
    To break the heart of generosity
    And make bold power look pale--they threw their caps             205
    As they would hang them on the horns o' the moon,
    Shouting their emulation.[2535]

    _Men._                    What is granted them?

    _Mar._ Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,[2536]
    Of their own choice: one's Junius Brutus,[2537]
    Sicinius Velutus, and I know not--'Sdeath![2538]                 210
    The rabble should have first unroof'd the city,[2539]
    Ere so prevail'd with me: it will in time
    Win upon power and throw forth greater themes[2540]
    For insurrection's arguing.[2541]

    _Men._                      This is strange.

    _Mar._ Go, get you home, you fragments!                          215

                 _Enter a_ Messenger, _hastily_.[2542]

    _Mess._ Where's Caius Marcius?

    _Mar._                          Here: what's the matter?[2543]

    _Mess._ The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.[2544]

    _Mar._ I am glad on't: then we shall ha' means to vent[2545]
    Our musty superfluity. See, our best elders.[2546]

     _Enter_ COMINIUS, TITUS LARTIUS, _and other_ Senators; JUNIUS
                  BRUTUS _and_ SICINIUS VELUTUS.[2547]

    _First Sen._ Marcius, 'tis true that you have lately
                  told us;[2548]  220
    The Volsces are in arms.

    _Mar._                   They have a leader,
    Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to't.
    I sin in envying his nobility;
    And were I any thing but what I am,
    I would wish me only he.

    _Com._                   You have fought together.[2549]         225

    _Mar._ Were half to half the world by the ears, and he
    Upon my party, I'ld revolt, to make
    Only my wars with him: he is a lion[2550]
    That I am proud to hunt.

    _First Sen._             Then, worthy Marcius,
    Attend upon Cominius to these wars.                              230

    _Com._ It is your former promise.

    _Mar._                            Sir, it is;
    And I am constant. Titus Lartius, thou[2551]
    Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.[2552]
    What, art thou stiff? stand'st out?

    _Tit._                              No, Caius Marcius;
    I'll lean upon one crutch, and fight with t'other,               235
    Ere stay behind this business.

    _Men._                         O, true-bred!

    _First Sen._ Your company to the Capitol; where, I know,[2553]
    Our greatest friends attend us.

    _Tit._                          [_To Com._] Lead you on.[2554][2555]
    [_To Mar._] Follow Cominius; we must follow you;[2554][2555]
    Right worthy you priority.[2555]

    _Com._                     Noble Marcius![2555][2556]            240

    _First Sen._ [_To the Citizens_] Hence to your homes; be gone![2553]

    _Mar._                                   Nay, let them follow:[2557]
    The Volsces have much corn; take these rats thither
    To gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutiners,[2558]
    Your valour puts well forth: pray, follow.

       [_Citizens steal away. Exeunt all but Sicinius and Brutus._[2559]

    _Sic._ Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius?                 245

    _Bru._ He has no equal.

    _Sic._ When we were chosen tribunes for the people,--

    _Bru._ Mark'd you his lip and eyes?

    _Sic._                               Nay, but his taunts.

    _Bru._ Being moved, he will not spare to gird the gods.[2560]

    _Sic._ Bemock the modest moon.                                   250

    _Bru._ The present wars devour him: he is grown[2561]
    Too proud to be so valiant.[2562]

    _Sic._                      Such a nature,[2563]
    Tickled with good success, disdains the shadow[2563]
    Which he treads on at noon: but I do wonder[2563]
    His insolence can brook to be commanded[2563]                    255
    Under Cominius.[2563]

    _Bru._          Fame, at the which he aims,[2564]
    In whom already he's well graced, can not[2565]
    Better be held, nor more attain'd, than by[2566]
    A place below the first: for what miscarries
    Shall be the general's fault, though he perform                  260
    To the utmost of a man; and giddy censure
    Will then cry out of Marcius 'O, if he[2567]
    Had borne the business!'

    _Sic._                   Besides, if things go well,
    Opinion, that so sticks on Marcius, shall
    Of his demerits rob Cominius.[2568]

    _Bru._                        Come:[2569]                        265
    Half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius,[2569][2570]
    Though Marcius earn'd them not; and all his faults[2571]
    To Marcius shall be honours, though indeed
    In aught he merit not.

    _Sic._                 Let's hence, and hear
    How the dispatch is made; and in what fashion,                   270
    More than his singularity, he goes[2572]
    Upon this present action.

    _Bru._                    Let's along.                    [_Exeunt._


SCENE II. _Corioli. The Senate-House._

      _Enter_ TULLUS AUFIDIUS, _with_ Senators _of Corioli_.[2573]

    _First Sen._ So, your opinion is, Aufidius,
    That they of Rome are enter'd in our counsels,
    And know how we proceed.

    _Auf._                   Is it not yours?
    What ever have been thought on in this state,[2574]
    That could be brought to bodily act ere Rome                       5
    Had circumvention? 'Tis not four days gone
    Since I heard thence: these are the words: I think
    I have the letter here: yes, here it is:
    [_Reads_] 'They have press'd a power, but it is not known[2575]
    Whether for east or west: the dearth is great;[2576]              10
    The people mutinous: and it is rumour'd,
    Cominius, Marcius your old enemy,
    Who is of Rome worse hated than of you,
    And Titus Lartius, a most valiant Roman,
    These three lead on this preparation                              15
    Whither 'tis bent: most likely 'tis for you:[2577]
    Consider of it.'

    _First Sen._     Our army's in the field:
    We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready
    To answer us.

    _Auf._        Nor did you think it folly
    To keep your great pretences veil'd till when[2578]               20
    They needs must show themselves; which in the hatching,
    It seem'd, appear'd to Rome. By the discovery[2579]
    We shall be shorten'd in our aim, which was
    To take in many towns ere almost Rome
    Should know we were afoot.

    _Sec. Sen._                Noble Aufidius,                        25
    Take your commission; hie you to your bands:
    Let us alone to guard Corioli:[2580][2581]
    If they set down before 's, for the remove[2581][2582]
    Bring up your army; but, I think, you'll find
    They've not prepared for us.[2583]

    _Auf._                       O, doubt not that;                   30
    I speak from certainties. Nay, more,[2584]
    Some parcels of their power are forth already,[2585]
    And only hitherward. I leave your honours.
    If we and Caius Marcius chance to meet,
    'Tis sworn between us, we shall ever strike[2586]                 35
    Till one can do no more.

    _All._                   The gods assist you!

    _Auf._ And keep your honours safe!

    _First Sen._                       Farewell.

    _Sec. Sen._                                  Farewell.

    _All._ Farewell.                                    [_Exeunt._[2587]


SCENE III. _Rome. A room in Marcius' house._

    _Enter_ VOLUMNIA _and_ VIRGILIA: _they set them down on two low
                        stools, and sew_.[2588]

    _Vol._ I pray you, daughter, sing, or express yourself in a
    more comfortable sort: if my son were my husband, I should[2589]
    freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he won honour than[2590]
    in the embracements of his bed where he would show most[2591]
    love. When yet he was but tender-bodied, and the only son          5
    of my womb; when youth with comeliness plucked all gaze
    his way; when, for a day of kings' entreaties, a mother[2592]
    should not sell him an hour from her beholding; I, considering[2593]
    how honour would become such a person; that it
    was no better than picture-like to hang by the wall, if renown    10
    made it not stir, was pleased to let him seek danger where
    he was like to find fame. To a cruel war I sent him; from
    whence he returned, his brows bound with oak. I tell thee,
    daughter, I sprang not more in joy at first hearing he was[2594]
    a man-child than now in first seeing he had proved himself        15
    a man.

    _Vir._ But had he died in the business, madam: how then?

    _Vol._ Then his good report should have been my son; I
    therein would have found issue. Hear me profess sincerely:
    had I a dozen sons, each in my love alike, and none less          20
    dear than thine and my good Marcius, I had rather had[2595]
    eleven die nobly for their country than one voluptuously
    surfeit out of action.

                         _Enter a_ Gentlewoman.

    _Gent._ Madam, the Lady Valeria is come to visit you.

    _Vir._ Beseech you, give me leave to retire myself.               25

    _Vol._ Indeed, you shall not.[2596]
    Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum;[2597]
    See him pluck Aufidius down by the hair;[2598]
    As children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him:[2599]
    Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus:[2600]               30
    'Come on, you cowards! you were got in fear,[2601]
    Though you were born in Rome:' his bloody brow
    With his mail'd hand then wiping, forth he goes,
    Like to a harvest-man that's task'd to mow[2602]
    Or all, or lose his hire.[2603]                                   35

    _Vir._ His bloody brow! O Jupiter, no blood!

    _Vol._ Away, you fool! it more becomes a man
    Than gilt his trophy: the breasts of Hecuba,[2604]
    When she did suckle Hector, look'd not lovelier
    Than Hector's forehead when it spit forth blood                   40
    At Grecian sword, contemning. Tell Valeria[2605]
    We are fit to bid her welcome.                   [_Exit Gent._[2606]

    _Vir._ Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius!

    _Vol._ He'll beat Aufidius' head below his knee,[2607]
    And tread upon his neck.                                          45

       _Enter_ VALERIA, _with an_ Usher _and_ Gentlewoman.[2608]

    _Val._ My ladies both, good day to you.[2609]

    _Vol._ Sweet madam.

    _Vir._ I am glad to see your ladyship.

    _Val._ How do you both? you are manifest house-keepers.
    What are you sewing here? A fine spot, in good faith.[2610]       50
    How does your little son?

    _Vir._ I thank your ladyship; well, good madam.

    _Vol._ He had rather see the swords and hear a drum[2611]
    than look upon his schoolmaster.

    _Val._ O' my word, the father's son: I'll swear, 'tis a very[2612]  55
    pretty boy. O' my troth, I looked upon him o' Wednesday[2612][2613]
    half an hour together: has such a confirmed countenance.[2614]
    I saw him run after a gilded butterfly; and when he caught
    it, he let it go again; and after it again; and over and over
    he comes, and up again; catched it again: or whether his[2615]    60
    fall enraged him, or how 'twas, he did so set his teeth, and
    tear it; O, I warrant, how he mammocked it!

    _Vol._ One on 's father's moods.[2616]

    _Val._ Indeed, la, 'tis a noble child.

    _Vir._ A crack, madam.                                            65

    _Val._ Come, lay aside your stitchery; I must have you
    play the idle huswife with me this afternoon.

    _Vir._ No, good madam; I will not out of doors.[2617]

    _Val._ Not out of doors!

    _Vol._ She shall, she shall.                                      70

    _Vir._ Indeed, no, by your patience; I'll not over the
    threshold till my lord return from the wars.

    _Val._ Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably:[2618]
    come, you must go visit the good lady that lies in.

    _Vir._ I will wish her speedy strength, and visit her with        75
    my prayers; but I cannot go thither.

    _Vol._ Why, I pray you?

    Vir. 'Tis not to save labour, nor that I want love.

    _Val._ You would be another Penelope: yet, they say, all
    the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill Ithaca[2619]   80
    full of moths. Come; I would your cambric were sensible
    as your finger, that you might leave pricking it for pity.
    Come, you shall go with us.

    _Vir._ No, good madam, pardon me; indeed, I will not
    forth.                                                            85

    _Val._ In truth, la, go with me, and I'll tell you excellent
    news of your husband.

    _Vir._ O, good madam, there can be none yet.

    _Val._ Verily, I do not jest with you; there came news
    from him last night.                                              90

    _Vir._ Indeed, madam?[2620]

    _Val._ In earnest, it's true; I heard a senator speak it.
    Thus it is: the Volsces have an army forth; against whom
    Cominius the general is gone, with one part of our Roman
    power: your lord and Titus Lartius are set down before            95
    their city Corioli; they nothing doubt prevailing, and to[2621]
    make it brief wars. This is true, on mine honour; and so,[2622]
    I pray, go with us.

    _Vir._ Give me excuse, good madam; I will obey you
    in every thing hereafter.                                        100

    _Vol._ Let her alone, lady; as she is now, she will but[2623][2624]
    disease our better mirth.[2623]

    _Val._ In troth, I think she would. Fare you well,[2623]
    then. Come, good sweet lady. Prithee, Virgilia, turn thy[2623]
    solemness out o' door, and go along with us.[2623][2625]         105

    _Vir._ No, at a word, madam; indeed, I must not. I[2623]
    wish you much mirth.[2623]

    _Val._ Well then, farewell.                         [_Exeunt._[2626]


SCENE IV. _Before Corioli._

    _Enter, with drum and colours_, MARCIUS, TITUS LARTIUS, Captains
              _and_ Soldiers. _To them a_ Messenger.[2627]

    _Mar._ Yonder comes news: a wager they have met.[2628]

    _Lart._ My horse to yours, no.[2629]

    _Mar._                         'Tis done.

    _Lart._                                   Agreed.

    _Mar._ Say, has our general met the enemy?

    _Mess._ They lie in view; but have not spoke as yet.

    _Lart._ So, the good horse is mine.

    _Mar._                               I'll buy him of you.          5

    _Lart._ No, I'll nor sell nor give him: lend you him I will[2630][2631]
    For half a hundred years. Summon the town.[2631]

    _Mar._ How far off lie these armies?

    _Mess._                               Within this mile and half.[2632]

    _Mar._ Then shall we hear their 'larum, and they ours.
    Now, Mars, I prithee, make us quick in work,                      10
    That we with smoking swords may march from hence,
    To help our fielded friends! Come, blow thy blast.

    _They sound a parley. Enter two_ Senators _with others, on the
                             walls_.[2633]

    Tullus Aufidius, is he within your walls?[2634][2635]

    _First Sen._ No, nor a man that fears you less than he,[2636]
    That's lesser than a little. Hark, our drums[2637]                15

                                                       [_Drum afar off._

    Are bringing forth our youth! we'll break our walls,
    Rather than they shall pound us up: our gates,[2638]
    Which yet seem shut, we have but pinn'd with rushes;
    They'll open of themselves. Hark you, far off!

                                                      [_Alarum far off._

    There is Aufidius; list, what work he makes[2634]                 20
    Amongst your cloven army.

    _Mar._                    O, they are at it!

    _Lart._ Their noise be our instruction. Ladders, ho!

                 _Enter the army of the_ Volsces.[2639]

    _Mar._ They fear us not, but issue forth their city.[2640]
    Now put your shields before your hearts, and fight
    With hearts more proof than shields. Advance, brave Titus:[2641]  25
    They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts,
    Which makes me sweat with wrath. Come on, my fellows:[2642]
    He that retires, I'll take him for a Volsce,[2643]
    And he shall feel mine edge.

   _Alarum._ _The_ Romans _are beat back to their trenches. Re-enter_
                       MARCIUS, _cursing_.[2644]

    _Mar._ All the contagion of the south light on you,[2645]         30
    You shames of Rome! you herd of--Boils and plagues[2646]
    Plaster you o'er; that you may be abhorr'd
    Farther than seen, and one infect another
    Against the wind a mile! You souls of geese,
    That bear the shapes of men, how have you run                     35
    From slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell!
    All hurt behind; backs red, and faces pale
    With flight and agued fear! Mend, and charge home,
    Or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foe,
    And make my wars on you: look to 't: come on;                     40
    If you'll stand fast, we'll beat them to their wives,[2647]
    As they us to our trenches followed.[2647][2648]

   _Another alarum. The_ Volsces _fly, and_ MARCIUS _follows them to
                           the gates_.[2649]

    So, now the gates are ope: now prove good seconds:
    'Tis for the followers fortune widens them,
    Not for the fliers: mark me, and do the like.        45

                                             [_Enters the gates._[2650]

    _First Sol._ Fool-hardiness; not I.

    _Sec. Sol._ Nor I.                      [_Marcius is shut in._[2651]

    _First Sol._ See, they have shut him in.

    _All._                                   To the pot, I warrant him.

                                                   [_Alarum continues._

                    _Re-enter_ TITUS LARTIUS.[2652]

    _Lart._ What is become of Marcius?

    _All._                             Slain, sir, doubtless.

    _First Sol._ Following the fliers at the very heels,              50
    With them he enters; who, upon the sudden,
    Clapp'd to their gates: he is himself alone,[2653]
    To answer all the city.

    _Lart._                 O noble fellow!
    Who sensibly outdares his senseless sword,[2654]
    And, when it bows, stands up! Thou art left, Marcius:[2655]       55
    A carbuncle entire, as big as thou art,
    Were not so rich a jewel. Thou wast a soldier[2656]
    Even to Cato's wish, not fierce and terrible[2657]
    Only in strokes; but, with thy grim looks and
    The thunder-like percussion of thy sounds,[2658]                  60
    Thou madest thine enemies shake, as if the world
    Were feverous and did tremble.

     _Re-enter_ MARCIUS, _bleeding, assaulted by the enemy_.[2659]

    _First Sol._ Look, sir.

    _Lart._ O, 'tis Marcius!
    Let's fetch him off, or make remain alike.

                                 [_They fight, and all enter the city._


SCENE V. _Within Corioli. A street._[2660]

                 _Enter certain_ Romans, _with spoils_.

    _First Rom._ This will I carry to Rome.

    _Sec. Rom._ And I this.

    _Third Rom._ A murrain on't! I took this for silver.

                                    [_Alarum continues still afar off._

      _Enter_ MARCIUS _and_ TITUS LARTIUS _with a trumpet_.[2661]

    _Mar._ See here these movers that do prize their hours[2662]
    At a crack'd drachma! Cushions, leaden spoons,[2663]               5
    Irons of a doit, doublets that hangmen would
    Bury with those that wore them, these base slaves,
    Ere yet the fight be done, pack up: down with them!
    And hark, what noise the general makes! To him![2664]
    There is the man of my soul's hate, Aufidius,                     10
    Piercing our Romans: then, valiant Titus, take
    Convenient numbers to make good the city;
    Whilst I, with those that have the spirit, will haste[2665]
    To help Cominius.

    _Lart._           Worthy sir, thou bleed'st;
    Thy exercise hath been too violent[2666]                          15
    For a second course of fight.[2666]

    _Mar._                        Sir, praise me not;
    My work hath yet not warm'd me: fare you well:
    The blood I drop is rather physical
    Than dangerous to me: to Aufidius thus[2667][2668]
    I will appear, and fight.[2667]

    _Lart._                   Now the fair goddess, Fortune,          20
    Fall deep in love with thee; and her great charms
    Misguide thy opposers' swords! Bold gentleman,[2669]
    Prosperity be thy page!

    _Mar._                  Thy friend no less
    Than those she placeth highest! So farewell.[2670]

    _Lart._ Thou worthiest Marcius!           [_Exit Marcius._[2671]  25
    Go, sound thy trumpet in the market-place;[2672]
    Call thither all the officers o' the town,[2673]
    Where they shall know our mind. Away!                     [_Exeunt._


SCENE VI. _Near the camp of Cominius._[2674]

        _Enter_ COMINIUS, _as it were in retire, with_ Soldiers.

    _Com._ Breathe you, my friends: well fought; we are come off
    Like Romans, neither foolish in our stands
    Nor cowardly in retire: believe me, sirs,
    We shall be charged again. Whiles we have struck,[2675]
    By interims and conveying gusts we have heard                      5
    The charges of our friends. Ye Roman gods,[2676]
    Lead their successes as we wish our own,
    That both our powers, with smiling fronts encountering,
    May give you thankful sacrifice!

                       _Enter a_ Messenger.[2677]

                                     Thy news?

    _Mess._ The citizens of Corioli have issued,                      10
    And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle:
    I saw our party to their trenches driven,[2678]
    And then I came away.

    _Com._                Though thou speak'st truth,[2679]
    Methinks thou speak'st not well. How long is't since?

    _Mess._ Above an hour, my lord.                                   15

    _Com._ 'Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums:[2680]
    How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour,
    And bring thy news so late?[2681]

    _Mess._                     Spies of the Volsces
    Held me in chase, that I was forced to wheel
    Three or four miles about; else had I, sir,                       20
    Half an hour since brought my report.

                         _Enter_ MARCIUS.[2682]

    _Com._                                Who's yonder,
    That does appear as he were flay'd? O gods!
    He has the stamp of Marcius; and I have
    Before-time seen him thus.

    _Mar._                     Come I too late?[2683]

    _Com._ The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabor                25
    More than I know the sound of Marcius' tongue[2684]
    From every meaner man.[2685]

    _Mar._                 Come I too late?

    _Com._ Ay, if you come not in the blood of others,
    But mantled in your own.

    _Mar._                   O, let me clip ye[2686]
    In arms as sound as when I woo'd; in heart[2687][2688]            30
    As merry as when our nuptial day was done,[2688]
    And tapers burn'd to bedward!

    _Com._                        Flower of warriors,[2689]
    How is't with Titus Lartius?[2689][2690]

    _Mar._ As with a man busied about decrees:
    Condemning some to death, and some to exile;                      35
    Ransoming him or pitying, threatening the other;
    Holding Corioli in the name of Rome,
    Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash,
    To let him slip at will.[2691]

    _Com._                   Where is that slave
    Which told me they had beat you to your trenches?                 40
    Where is he? call him hither.

    _Mar._                        Let him alone;
    He did inform the truth: but for our gentlemen,[2692]
    The common file--a plague! tribunes for them!--[2693]
    The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge
    From rascals worse than they.

    _Com._                        But how prevail'd you?              45

    _Mar._ Will the time serve to tell? I do not think.[2694]
    Where is the enemy? are you lords o' the field?[2695]
    If not, why cease you till you are so?

    _Com._                                 Marcius,[2696]
    We have at disadvantage fought and did[2696]
    Retire to win our purpose.[2696][2697]                          50

    _Mar._ How lies their battle? know you on which side[2698][2699]
    They have placed their men of trust?[2698]

    _Com._                               As I guess, Marcius,
    Their bands i' the vaward are the Antiates,[2700]
    Of their best trust; o'er them Aufidius,
    Their very heart of hope.

    _Mar._                    I do beseech you,                       55
    By all the battles wherein we have fought,
    By the blood we have shed together, by the vows[2701][2702]
    We have made to endure friends, that you directly[2701][2702]
    Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates;[2701]
    And that you not delay the present, but,                          60
    Filling the air with swords advanced and darts,
    We prove this very hour.[2703]

    _Com._                   Though I could wish
    You were conducted to a gentle bath,
    And balms applied to you, yet dare I never
    Deny your asking: take your choice of those                       65
    That best can aid your action.

    _Mar._                         Those are they
    That most are willing. If any such be here--[2704]
    As it were sin to doubt--that love this painting
    Wherein you see me smear'd; if any fear
    Lesser his person than an ill report;[2705]                       70
    If any think brave death outweighs bad life,
    And that his country's dearer than himself;
    Let him alone, or so many so minded,[2706]
    Wave thus, to express his disposition,
    And follow Marcius.                                               75

                       [_They all shout, and wave their swords; take him
                              up in their arms, and cast up their caps._

    O, me alone! make you a sword of me?[2707]
    If these shows be not outward, which of you
    But is four Volsces? none of you but is
    Able to bear against the great Aufidius
    A shield as hard as his. A certain number,[2708]                  80
    Though thanks to all, must I select from all: the rest[2709]
    Shall bear the business in some other fight,
    As cause will be obey'd. Please you to march;[2710]
    And four shall quickly draw out my command,[2710][2711][2712]
    Which men are best inclined.[2712]

    _Com._                       March on, my fellows:                85
    Make good this ostentation, and you shall
    Divide in all with us.                                    [_Exeunt._


SCENE VII. _The gates of Corioli._[2713]

    TITUS LARTIUS, _having set a guard upon Corioli, going with
        drum and trumpet toward_ COMINIUS _and_ CAIUS MARCIUS,
        _enters with a_ Lieutenant, _other_ Soldiers, _and a_ Scout.

    _Lart._ So, let the ports be guarded: keep your duties,
    As I have set them down. If I do send, dispatch[2714]
    Those centuries to our aid; the rest will serve[2715]
    For a short holding: if we lose the field,
    We cannot keep the town.[2716]

    _Lieu._                  Fear not our care, sir.[2716]             5

    _Lart._ Hence, and shut your gates upon 's.[2716][2717]
    Our guider, come; to the Roman camp conduct us. [_Exeunt._[2716][2718]


SCENE VIII. _A field of battle between the Roman and the Volscian
camps._

    _Alarum as in battle. Enter, from opposite sides,_ MARCIUS _and_
                            AUFIDIUS.[2719]

    _Mar._ I'll fight with none but thee; for I do hate thee
    Worse than a promise-breaker.

    _Auf._                         We hate alike:
    Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor[2720]
    More than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot.[2721][2722]

    _Mar._ Let the first budger die the other's slave,[2722]           5
    And the gods doom him after!

    _Auf._                       If I fly, Marcius,[2723]
    Holloa me like a hare.[2723][2724]

    _Mar._                 Within these three hours, Tullus,
    Alone I fought in your Corioli walls,
    And made what work I pleased: 'tis not my blood
    Wherein thou seest me mask'd; for thy revenge                     10
    Wrench up thy power to the highest.

    _Auf._                              Wert thou the Hector[2725]
    That was the whip of your bragg'd progeny,
    Thou shouldst not 'scape me here.

          [_They fight, and certain Volsces come in the aid of Aufidius.
                Marcius fights till they be driven in breathless._[2726]

    Officious, and not valiant, you have shamed me
    In your condemned seconds.                      [_Exeunt._[2727]  15


SCENE IX. _The Roman camp._

    _Flourish. Alarum. A retreat is sounded. Enter, from one side_,
        COMINIUS _with the_ Romans; _from the other side_, MARCIUS,
        _with his arm in a scarf_.[2728]

    _Com._ If I should tell thee o'er this thy day's work,
    Thou'ldst not believe thy deeds: but I'll report it,[2729]
    Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles;
    Where great patricians shall attend, and shrug,[2730]
    I' the end admire; where ladies shall be frighted,                 5
    And, gladly quaked, hear more; where the dull tribunes,
    That, with the fusty plebeians, hate thine honours,[2731]
    Shall say against their hearts 'We thank the gods
    Our Rome hath such a soldier.'
    Yet camest thou to a morsel of this feast,                        10
    Having fully dined before.

    _Enter_ TITUS LARTIUS, _with his power, from the pursuit_.[2732]

    _Lart._                    O general,
    Here is the steed, we the caparison:[2733]
    Hadst thou beheld--[2734]

    _Mar._              Pray now, no more: my mother,[2735]
    Who has a charter to extol her blood,[2735]
    When she does praise me grieves me. I have done[2736]             15
    As you have done; that's what I can: induced[2736]
    As you have been; that's for my country:[2736]
    He that has but effected his good will
    Hath overta'en mine act.

    _Com._                   You shall not be[2737]
    The grave of your deserving; Rome must know[2737]               20
    The value of her own: 'twere a concealment[2737]
    Worse than a theft, no less than a traducement,[2737]
    To hide your doings; and to silence that,
    Which, to the spire and top of praises vouch'd,
    Would seem but modest: therefore, I beseech you--                 25
    In sign of what you are, not to reward
    What you have done--before our army hear me.

    _Mar._ I have some wounds upon me, and they smart
    To hear themselves remember'd.

    _Com._                         Should they not,
    Well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude,                       30
    And tent themselves with death. Of all the horses,
    Whereof we have ta'en good, and good store, of all[2738]
    The treasure in this field achieved and city,[2739]
    We render you the tenth; to be ta'en forth,
    Before the common distribution, at[2740][2741]                    35
    Your only choice.[2741]

    _Mar._            I thank you, general;
    But cannot make my heart consent to take
    A bribe to pay my sword: I do refuse it,
    And stand upon my common part with those
    That have beheld the doing.[2742]                                 40

[_A long flourish. They all cry_ 'Marcius! Marcius!' _cast up their
caps and lances: Cominius and Lartius stand bare_.


    _Mar._ May these same instruments, which you profane,[2743]
    Never sound more! when drums and trumpets shall[2743]
    I' the field prove flatterers, let courts and cities be[2743][2744][2745]
    Made all of false-faced soothing![2743][2745][2746]
    When steel grows soft as the parasite's silk,[2743][2747]         45
    Let him be made a coverture for the wars![2743][2748][2749]
    No more, I say! For that I have not wash'd[2743][2749][2750]
    My nose that bled, or foil'd some debile wretch,[2743]
    Which without note here's many else have done,[2743]
    You shout me forth[2743][2751][2752]                              50
    In acclamations hyperbolical;[2743][2751]
    As if I loved my little should be dieted[2743]
    In praises sauced with lies.[2743]

    _Com._                       Too modest are you;
    More cruel to your good report than grateful
    To us that give you truly: by your patience,[2753]                55
    If 'gainst yourself you be incensed, we'll put you,[2754]
    Like one that means his proper harm, in manacles,
    Then reason safely with you. Therefore, be it known,
    As to us, to all the world, that Caius Marcius
    Wears this war's garland: in token of the which,                  60
    My noble steed, known to the camp, I give him,[2755]
    With all his trim belonging; and from this time,
    For what he did before Corioli, call him,
    With all the applause and clamour of the host,

    CAIUS MARCIUS CORIOLANUS. Bear[2756][2757]                        65
    The addition nobly ever! [_Flourish. Trumpets sound, and drums._[2756]

    _All._ Caius Marcius Coriolanus![2757][2758]

    _Cor._ I will go wash;[2759]
    And when my face is fair, you shall perceive
    Whether I blush, or no: howbeit, I thank you:                     70
    I mean to stride your steed; and at all times
    To undercrest your good addition
    To the fairness of my power.[2760]

    _Com._                       So, to our tent;
    Where, ere we do repose us, we will write[2761]
    To Rome of our success. You, Titus Lartius,                       75
    Must to Corioli back: send us to Rome
    The best, with whom we may articulate
    For their own good and ours.

    _Lart._                      I shall, my lord.

    _Cor._ The gods begin to mock me. I, that now[2759][2762][2763]
    Refused most princely gifts, am bound to beg[2762]                80
    Of my lord general.[2762][2764]

    _Com._              Take 't; 'tis yours. What is't?[2764][2765]

    _Cor._ I sometime lay here in Corioli[2759][2764]
    At a poor man's house; he used me kindly:[2764][2766]
    He cried to me; I saw him prisoner;
    But then Aufidius was within my view,                             85
    And wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity: I request you
    To give my poor host freedom.

    _Com._                         O, well begg'd!
    Were he the butcher of my son, he should
    Be free as is the wind. Deliver him, Titus.

    _Lart._ Marcius, his name?

    _Cor._                     By Jupiter, forgot:[2759]              90
    I am weary; yea, my memory is tired.[2767]
    Have we no wine here?

    _Com._                Go we to our tent:
    The blood upon your visage dries; 'tis time
    It should be look'd to: come.                             [_Exeunt._


SCENE X. _The camp of the Volsces._[2768]

    _A flourish. Cornets. Enter_ TULLUS AUFIDIUS, _bloody, with two
                          or three_ Soldiers.

    _Auf._ The town is ta'en![2769]

    _First Sol._ 'Twill be deliver'd back on good condition.[2770][2769]

    _Auf._ Condition!
    I would I were a Roman; for I cannot,
    Being a Volsce, be that I am. Condition![2771]                     5
    What good condition can a treaty find
    I' the part that is at mercy? Five times, Marcius,
    I have fought with thee; so often hast thou beat me;
    And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounter
    As often as we eat. By the elements,[2772]                        10
    If e'er again I meet him beard to beard,
    He's mine, or I am his: mine emulation
    Hath not that honour in 't it had; for where
    I thought to crush him in an equal force,
    True sword to sword, I'll potch at him some way,[2773]            15
    Or wrath or craft may get him.

    _First Sol._                   He's the devil.[2770]

    _Auf._ Bolder, though not so subtle. My valour's poison'd[2774][2775]
    With only suffering stain by him; for him[2775][2776]
    Shall fly out of itself: nor sleep nor sanctuary,[2777]
    Being naked, sick, nor fane nor Capitol,[2778]                    20
    The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice,
    Embarquements all of fury, shall lift up[2779]
    Their rotten privilege and custom 'gainst
    My hate to Marcius: where I find him, were it
    At home, upon my brother's guard, even there,[2780]               25
    Against the hospitable canon, would I
    Wash my fierce hand in's heart. Go you to the city;
    Learn how 'tis held, and what they are that must
    Be hostages for Rome.

    _First Sol._          Will not you go?[2770]

    _Auf._ I am attended at the cypress grove: I pray you--[2781]     30
    'Tis south the city mills--bring me word thither[2782]
    How the world goes, that to the pace of it
    I may spur on my journey.

    _First Sol._              I shall, sir.       [_Exeunt._[2770][2783]

ACT II.


SCENE I. _Rome. A public place._

   _Enter_ MENENIUS, _with the two Tribunes of the people_, SICINIUS,
                          _and_ BRUTUS.[2784]

    _Men._ The augurer tells me we shall have news to-night.[2785]

    _Bru._ Good or bad?

    _Men._ Not according to the prayer of the people, for
    they love not Marcius.

    _Sic._ Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.                5

    _Men._ Pray you, who does the wolf love?[2786]

    _Sic._ The lamb.

    _Men._ Ay, to devour him; as the hungry plebeians would
    the noble Marcius.

    _Bru._ He's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear.                 10

    _Men._ He's a bear indeed, that lives like a lamb. You
    two are old men: tell me one thing that I shall ask you.

    _Both._ Well, sir.

    _Men._ In what enormity is Marcius poor in, that you[2787]
    two have not in abundance?                                        15

    _Bru._ He's poor in no one fault, but stored with all.[2788]

    _Sic._ Especially in pride.[2789]

    _Bru._ And topping all others in boasting.[2790]

    _Men._ This is strange now: do you two know how you
    are censured here in the city, I mean of us o' the right-hand[2791]  20
    file? do you?

    _Both._ Why, how are we censured?[2792]

    _Men._ Because you talk of pride now,--will you not be
    angry?

    _Both._ Well, well, sir, well.                                    25

    _Men._ Why, 'tis no great matter; for a very little thief of
    occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience: give your
    dispositions the reins, and be angry at your pleasures; at[2793]
    the least, if you take it as a pleasure to you in being so.
    You blame Marcius for being proud?[2794]                          30

    _Bru._ We do it not alone, sir.

    _Men._ I know you can do very little alone; for your helps
    are many, or else your actions would grow wondrous single:
    your abilities are too infant-like for doing much alone. You
    talk of pride: O that you could turn your eyes toward the[2795]   35
    napes of your necks, and make but an interior survey of
    your good selves! O that you could!

    _Both._ What then, sir?[2796]

    _Men._ Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting,[2797]
    proud, violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, as                40
    any in Rome.

    _Sic._ Menenius, you are known well enough too.

    _Men._ I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one
    that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying Tiber[2798]
    in't; said to be something imperfect in favouring the first[2799][2800]  45
    complaint, hasty and tinder-like upon too trivial motion;[2799][2801]
    one that converses more with the buttock of the night than
    with the forehead of the morning: what I think I utter, and
    spend my malice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen
    as you are,--I cannot call you Lycurguses--if the drink[2802]     50
    you give me touch my palate adversely, I make a crooked
    face at it. I can't say your worships have delivered the[2803]
    matter well, when I find the ass in compound with the major
    part of your syllables: and though I must be content to bear
    with those that say you are reverend grave men, yet they[2804]    55
    lie deadly that tell you you have good faces. If you see this[2805]
    in the map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known
    well enough too? what harm can your bisson conspectuities[2806]
    glean out of this character, if I be known well enough too?

    _Bru._ Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.                  60

    _Men._ You know neither me, yourselves, nor any thing.
    You are ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs: you wear
    out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a cause between
    an orange-wife and a fosset-seller, and then rejourn the controversy[2807]
    of three-pence to a second day of audience. When                  65
    you are hearing a matter between party and party, if you[2808]
    chance to be pinched with the colic, you make faces like
    mummers; set up the bloody flag against all patience; and,
    in roaring for a chamber-pot, dismiss the controversy bleeding,[2809]
    the more entangled by your hearing: all the peace you             70
    make in their cause is, calling both the parties knaves. You
    are a pair of strange ones.

    _Bru._ Come, come, you are well understood to be a perfecter
    giber for the table than a necessary bencher in the
    Capitol.                                                          75

    _Men._ Our very priests must become mockers, if they
    shall encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When[2810]
    you speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth the wagging[2810]
    of your beards; and your beards deserve not so honourable
    a grave as to stuff a botcher's cushion, or to be entombed        80
    in an ass's pack-saddle. Yet you must be saying, Marcius is[2811]
    proud; who, in a cheap estimation, is worth all your predecessors
    since Deucalion; though peradventure some of the
    best of 'em were hereditary hangmen. God-den to your[2812]
    worships: more of your conversation would infect my brain,        85
    being the herdsmen of the beastly plebeians: I will be bold[2813]
    to take my leave of you.            [_Brutus and Sicinius go aside._

            _Enter_ VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, _and_ VALERIA.[2814]

    How now, my as fair as noble ladies,--and the moon, were[2815]
    she earthly, no nobler--whither do you follow your eyes so
    fast?                                                             90

    _Vol._ Honourable Menenius, my boy Marcius approaches;
    for the love of Juno, let's go.

    _Men._ Ha! Marcius coming home!

    _Vol._ Ay, worthy Menenius; and with most prosperous
    approbation.                                                      95

    _Men._ Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee. Hoo![2816]
    Marcius coming home![2817]

    _Vir._} Nay, 'tis true.[2818]
    _Val._}

    _Vol._ Look, here's a letter from him: the state hath
    another, his wife another; and, I think, there's one at home     100
    for you.

    _Men._ I will make my very house reel to-night: a letter
    for me!

    _Vir._ Yes, certain, there's a letter for you; I saw 't.

    _Men._ A letter for me! it gives me an estate of seven           105
    years' health; in which time I will make a lip at the physician:
    the most sovereign prescription in Galen is but empiricutic,[2819]
    and, to this preservative, of no better report than a
    horse-drench. Is he not wounded? he was wont to come
    home wounded.                                                    110

    _Vir._ O, no, no, no.

    _Vol._ O, he is wounded; I thank the gods for't.

    _Men._ So do I too, if it be not too much: brings a' victory[2820]
    in his pocket? the wounds become him.[2821]

    _Vol._ On's brows: Menenius, he comes the third time[2822]       115
    home with the oaken garland.

    _Men._ Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?[2823]

    _Vol._ Titus Lartius writes, they fought together, but
    Aufidius got off.

    _Men._ And 'twas time for him too, I'll warrant him that:        120
    an he had stayed by him, I would not have been so fidiused[2824]
    for all the chests in Corioli, and the gold that's in them. Is
    the senate possessed of this?

    _Vol._ Good ladies, let's go. Yes, yes, yes; the senate has
    letters from the general, wherein he gives my son the whole      125
    name of the war: he hath in this action outdone his former
    deeds doubly.

    _Val._ In troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.

    _Men._ Wondrous! ay, I warrant you, and not without
    his true purchasing.                                             130

    _Vir._ The gods grant them true!

    _Vol._ True! pow, wow.[2825]

    _Men._ True! I'll be sworn they are true. Where is he
    wounded? [_To the Tribunes_] God save your good worships![2826][2827]
    Marcius is coming home: he has more cause to be[2826]            135
    proud. Where is he wounded?

    _Vol._ I' the shoulder and i' the left arm: there will be[2828]
    large cicatrices to show the people, when he shall stand for
    his place. He received in the repulse of Tarquin seven
    hurts i' the body.                                               140

    _Men._ One i' the neck, and two i' the thigh; there's nine[2829]
    that I know.

    _Vol._ He had, before this last expedition, twenty five[2830]
    wounds upon him.

    _Men._ Now it's twenty seven: every gash was an enemy's[2831]    145
    grave. [_A shout and flourish._] Hark! the trumpets.[2832]

    _Vol._ These are the ushers of Marcius: before him he[2833]
    carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears:[2833]
    Death, that dark spirit, in's nervy arm doth lie;[2834]
    Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die.[2834]         150

    _A sennet. Trumpets sound. Enter_ COMINIUS _and_ TITUS
        LARTIUS; _between them_, CORIOLANUS, _crowned with an
        oaken garland; with_ Captains _and_ Soldiers, _and a_
        Herald.[2835]

    _Her._ Know, Rome, that all alone Marcius did fight[2836]
    Within Corioli gates: where he hath won,[2837]
    With fame, a name to Caius Marcius; these[2838][2839]
    In honour follows Coriolanus.[2839][2840]
    Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!  [_Flourish._[2841][2842]  155

    _All._ Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus![2841]

    _Cor._ No more of this, it does offend my heart;[2843]
    Pray now, no more.[2843]

    _Com._             Look, sir, your mother![2843]

    _Cor._                                     O,[2843]
    You have, I know, petition'd all the gods[2843]
    For my prosperity!                                  [_Kneels._[2843]

    _Vol._             Nay, my good soldier, up;[2844]               160
    My gentle Marcius, worthy Caius, and[2845]
    By deed-achieving honour newly named,--[2845][2846]
    What is it?--Coriolanus must I call thee?--
    But, O, thy wife!

    _Cor._            My gracious silence, hail![2847]
    Wouldst thou have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home,              165
    That weep'st to see me triumph? Ah, my dear,
    Such eyes the widows in Corioli wear,[2848]
    And mothers that lack sons.

    _Men._                      Now, the gods crown thee!

    _Cor._ And live you yet? [_To Valeria_] O my sweet lady, pardon.[2849]

    _Vol._ I know not where to turn: O, welcome home:[2850]          170
    And welcome, general: and ye're welcome all.[2850][2851]

    _Men._ A hundred thousand welcomes. I could weep[2852]
    And I could laugh, I am light and heavy. Welcome:[2852][2853]
    A curse begin at very root on's heart,[2852][2854]
    That is not glad to see thee! You are three[2852]                175
    That Rome should dote on: yet, by the faith of men,[2852]
    We have some old crab-trees here at home that will not[2852][2855]
    Be grafted to your relish. Yet welcome, warriors:[2852][2856]
    We call a nettle but a nettle, and[2852]
    The faults of fools but folly.[2852]

    _Com._                         Ever right.[2857]                 180

    _Cor._ Menenius, ever, ever.[2857][2858]

    _Her._ Give way there, and go on.

    _Cor._ [_To Volumnia and Virgilia_] Your hand, and yours:[2859]
    Ere in our own house I do shade my head,
    The good patricians must be visited;
    From whom I have received not only greetings,                    185
    But with them change of honours.[2860]

    _Vol._                           I have lived
    To see inherited my very wishes
    And the buildings of my fancy: only[2861][2862]
    There's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but[2861][2863]
    Our Rome will cast upon thee.[2861]

    _Cor._                        Know, good mother,[2864]           190
    I had rather be their servant in my way
    Than sway with them in theirs.

    _Com._                         On, to the Capitol!

                        [_Flourish. Cornets. Exeunt in state, as before.
                                Brutus and Sicinius come forward._[2865]

    _Bru._ All tongues speak of him, and the bleared sights[2866]
    Are spectacled to see him: your prattling nurse
    Into a rapture lets her baby cry[2867]                           195
    While she chats him: the kitchen malkin pins[2868]
    Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,
    Clambering the walls to eye him: stalls, bulks, windows,[2869][2870]
    Are smother'd up, leads fill'd and ridges horsed[2869]
    With variable complexions, all agreeing                          200
    In earnestness to see him: seld-shown flamens[2871]
    Do press among the popular throngs, and puff
    To win a vulgar station: our veil'd dames
    Commit the war of white and damask in[2872][2873]
    Their nicely-gawded cheeks to the wanton spoil[2873]             205
    Of Phœbus' burning kisses: such a pother,[2874]
    As if that whatsoever god who leads him
    Were slily crept into his human powers,[2875]
    And gave him graceful posture.[2876]

    _Sic._                         On the sudden,[2877]
    I warrant him consul.[2877]

    _Bru._                Then our office may,[2877]                 210
    During his power, go sleep.[2877]

    _Sic._ He cannot temperately transport his honours
    From where he should begin and end, but will[2878]
    Lose those he hath won.[2879]

    _Bru._                  In that there's comfort.

    _Sic._                                           Doubt not
    The commoners, for whom we stand, but they                       215
    Upon their ancient malice will forget
    With the least cause these his new honours; which[2880]
    That he will give them make I as little question[2881]
    As he is proud to do 't.[2882]

    _Bru._                   I heard him swear,
    Were he to stand for consul, never would he                      220
    Appear i' the market-place, nor on him put
    The napless vesture of humility,[2883]
    Nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds
    To the people, beg their stinking breaths.

    _Sic._                                     'Tis right.

    _Bru._ It was his word: O, he would miss it rather[2884]         225
    Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him[2884]
    And the desire of the nobles.[2884][2885]

    _Sic._                        I wish no better[2886]
    Than have him hold that purpose and to put it[2886]
    In execution.[2886]

    _Bru._        'Tis most like he will.

    _Sic._ It shall be to him then, as our good wills,[2887][2888]   230
    A sure destruction.[2887]

    _Bru._              So it must fall out
    To him or our authorities. For an end,[2889]
    We must suggest the people in what hatred
    He still hath held them; that to's power he would[2890]
    Have made them mules, silenced their pleaders and[2891]          235
    Dispropertied their freedoms; holding them,[2892]
    In human action and capacity,[2892]
    Of no more soul nor fitness for the world
    Than camels in the war, who have their provand[2893]
    Only for bearing burthens, and sore blows                        240
    For sinking under them.

    _Sic._                  This, as you say, suggested
    At some time when his soaring insolence[2894]
    Shall touch the people--which time shall not want,[2895][2896]
    If he be put upon 't; and that's as easy
    As to set dogs on sheep--will be his fire[2897]                  245
    To kindle their dry stubble; and their blaze
    Shall darken him for ever.

                          _Enter a_ Messenger.

    _Bru._                     What's the matter?

    _Mess._ You are sent for to the Capitol. 'Tis thought[2898][2899]
    That Marcius shall be consul:[2898]
    I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and[2898]         250
    The blind to hear him speak: matrons flung gloves,[2898][2900]
    Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers,[2901]
    Upon him as he pass'd: the nobles bended,
    As to Jove's statue, and the commons made
    A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts:                 255
    I never saw the like.

    _Bru._                Let's to the Capitol,
    And carry with us ears and eyes for the time,
    But hearts for the event.

    _Sic._                    Have with you.                  [_Exeunt._


SCENE II. _The same. The Capitol._

             _Enter two_ Officers, _to lay cushions_.[2902]

    _First Off._ Come, come, they are almost here. How
    many stand for consulships?

    _Sec. Off._ Three, they say: but 'tis thought of every
    one Coriolanus will carry it.

    _First Off._ That's a brave fellow; but he's vengeance             5
    proud, and loves not the common people.

    _Sec. Off._ Faith, there have been many great men that
    have flattered the people, who ne'er loved them; and there
    be many that they have loved, they know not wherefore: so
    that, if they love they know not why, they hate upon no           10
    better a ground: therefore, for Coriolanus neither to care
    whether they love or hate him manifests the true knowledge
    he has in their disposition; and out of his noble carelessness
    lets them plainly see 't.[2903]

    _First Off._ If he did not care whether he had their love         15
    or no, he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither good[2904]
    nor harm: but he seeks their hate with greater devotion
    than they can render it him, and leaves nothing undone
    that may fully discover him their opposite. Now, to seem
    to affect the malice and displeasure of the people is as bad      20
    as that which he dislikes, to flatter them for their love.

    _Sec. Off._ He hath deserved worthily of his country: and
    his ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who, having[2905]
    been supple and courteous to the people, bonneted, without[2906]
    any further deed to have them at all into their estimation[2906][2907]  25
    and report: but he hath so planted his honours in their
    eyes and his actions in their hearts, that for their tongues
    to be silent and not confess so much, were a kind of ingrateful
    injury; to report otherwise were a malice that,
    giving itself the lie, would pluck reproof and rebuke from        30
    every ear that heard it.

    _First Off._ No more of him; he's a worthy man: make[2908]
    way, they are coming.

    _A sennet. Enter, with_ Lictors _before them_, COMINIUS _the
        Consul_, MENENIUS, CORIOLANUS, Senators, SICINIUS _and_
        BRUTUS. _The_ Senators _take their places; the_ Tribunes
        _take their place by themselves_. CORIOLANUS _stands_.[2909]

    _Men._ Having determined of the Volsces and[2910][2911]
    To send for Titus Lartius, it remains,[2911]                      35
    As the main point of this our after-meeting,
    To gratify his noble service that[2912]
    Hath thus stood for his country: therefore, please you,[2912]
    Most reverend and grave elders, to desire
    The present consul, and last general[2913]                        40
    In our well-found successes, to report[2913]
    A little of that worthy work perform'd
    By Caius Marcius Coriolanus; whom[2914]
    We met here, both to thank and to remember[2915]
    With honours like himself.

    _First Sen._               Speak, good Cominius:                  45
    Leave nothing out for length, and make us think
    Rather our state's defective for requital[2916]
    Than we to stretch it out. [_To the Tribunes_] Masters o' the people,[2917]
    We do request your kindest ears, and after,[2918]
    Your loving motion toward the common body,                        50
    To yield what passes here.[2919][2920]

    _Sic._                     We are convented[2920]
    Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts[2920][2921]
    Inclinable to honour and advance[2920]
    The theme of our assembly.[2920][2922]

    _Bru._                     Which the rather[2920]
    We shall be bless'd to do, if he remember[2920][2923]           55
    A kinder value of the people than[2920]
    He hath hereto prized them at.[2920][2924]

    _Men._                         That's off, that's off;[2920]
    I would you rather had been silent. Please you[2920]
    To hear Cominius speak?[2920]

    _Bru._                  Most willingly:[2920]
    But yet my caution was more pertinent[2920]                     60
    Than the rebuke you give it.[2920][2925]

    _Men._                       He loves your people;[2920]
    But tie him not to be their bedfellow.[2920]
    Worthy Cominius, speak. [_Coriolanus offers to go away._][2920][2926]
             Nay, keep your place.[2920]

    _First Sen._ Sit, Coriolanus; never shame to hear[2927]
    What you have nobly done.

    _Cor._                    Your honours' pardon:[2928]             65
    I had rather have my wounds to heal again
    Than hear say how I got them.

    _Bru._                        Sir, I hope[2929]
    My words disbench'd you not.[2929]

    _Cor._                       No, sir: yet oft,[2930]
    When blows have made me stay, I fled from words.
    You sooth'd not, therefore hurt not: but your people,[2931]       70
    I love them as they weigh.[2932]

    _Men._                     Pray now, sit down.

    _Cor._ I had rather have one scratch my head i' the sun
    When the alarum were struck than idly sit[2933]
    To hear my nothings monster'd.                        [_Exit._[2934]

    _Men._                         Masters of the people,
    Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter--[2935]                 75
    That's thousand to one good one--when you now see[2936]
    He had rather venture all his limbs for honour
    Than one on's ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius.[2937]

    _Com._ I shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus
    Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held[2938]                    80
    That valour is the chiefest virtue and[2939]
    Most dignifies the haver: if it be,
    The man I speak of cannot in the world
    Be singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,
    When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought                      85
    Beyond the mark of others: our then dictator,
    Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight,
    When with his Amazonian chin he drove[2940]
    The bristled lips before him: he bestrid[2941]
    An o'er-press'd Roman, and i' the consul's view                   90
    Slew three opposers: Tarquin's self he met,
    And struck him on his knee: in that day's feats,
    When he might act the woman in the scene,
    He proved best man i' the field, and for his meed
    Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age[2942]                  95
    Man-enter'd thus, he waxed like a sea;[2943]
    And, in the brunt of seventeen battles since,
    He lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last,[2944]
    Before and in Corioli, let me say,
    I cannot speak him home: he stopp'd the fliers;                  100
    And by his rare example made the coward
    Turn terror into sport: as weeds before[2945]
    A vessel under sail, so men obey'd,
    And fell below his stem: his sword, death's stamp,[2946]
    Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot[2947]              105
    He was a thing of blood, whose every motion[2947]
    Was timed with dying cries: alone he enter'd[2948]
    The mortal gate of the city, which he painted[2949]
    With shunless destiny; aidless came off,[2950]
    And with a sudden re-enforcement struck                          110
    Corioli like a planet: now all's his:[2951]
    When, by and by, the din of war gan pierce[2952]
    His ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit[2953]
    Re-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate,
    And to the battle came he; where he did                          115
    Run reeking o'er the lives of men, as if[2954][2955]
    'Twere a perpetual spoil: and till we call'd[2954]
    Both field and city ours, he never stood
    To ease his breast with panting.[2956]

    _Men._                           Worthy man!

    _First Sen._ He cannot but with measure fit the
        honours[2957][2958][2959]  120
    Which we devise him.[2958]

    _Com._               Our spoils he kick'd at,
    And look'd upon things precious, as they were
    The common muck of the world: he covets less[2960]
    Than misery itself would give; rewards[2961][2962]
    His deeds with doing them, and is content[2961]                  125
    To spend the time to end it.[2963]

    _Men._                       He's right noble:[2964]
    Let him be call'd for.[2964]

    _First Sen._           Call Coriolanus.[2965]

    _Off._ He doth appear.

                      _Re-enter_ CORIOLANUS.[2966]

    _Men._ The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased[2967]
    To make thee consul.[2967]

    _Cor._               I do owe them still[2967]                   130
    My life and services.[2967]

    _Men._                It then remains[2967]
    That you do speak to the people.[2967]

    _Cor._                           I do beseech you,[2968]
    Let me o'erleap that custom, for I cannot
    Put on the gown, stand naked, and entreat them,
    For my wounds' sake, to give their suffrage: please you[2969][2970]  135
    That I may pass this doing.[2969]

    _Sic._                      Sir, the people[2969][2971]
    Must have their voices; neither will they bate[2969][2972]
    One jot of ceremony.[2969]

    _Men._               Put them not to't:[2969]
    Pray you, go fit you to the custom, and[2969][2973]
    Take to you, as your predecessors have,[2969][2974]              140
    Your honour with your form.[2975]

    _Cor._                      It is a part[2976]
    That I shall blush in acting, and might well[2976]
    Be taken from the people.[2976][2977]

    _Bru._                    Mark you that?

    _Cor._ To brag unto them, thus I did, and thus;[2978]
    Show them the unaching scars which I should hide,[2978][2979]    145
    As if I had received them for the hire
    Of their breath only!

    _Men._             Do not stand upon't.
    We recommend to you, tribunes of the people,[2980]
    Our purpose to them: and to our noble consul[2981]
    Wish we all joy and honour.                                      150

    _Senators._ To Coriolanus come all joy and honour!

       [_Flourish of cornets. Exeunt all but Sicinius and Brutus._[2982]

    _Bru._ You see how he intends to use the people.

    _Sic._ May they perceive's intent! He will require them,[2983]
    As if he did contemn what he requested
    Should be in them to give.

    _Bru._                     Come, we'll inform them               155
    Of our proceedings here: on the market-place,[2984]
    I know, they do attend us.                          [_Exeunt._[2985]


SCENE III. _The same. The Forum._

                 _Enter seven or eight_ Citizens.[2986]

    _First Cit._ Once, if he do require our voices, we ought[2987]
    not to deny him.

    _Sec. Cit._ We may, sir, if we will.

    _Third Cit._ We have power in ourselves to do it, but it
    is a power that we have no power to do: for if he show us          5
    his wounds and tell us his deeds, we are to put our tongues[2988]
    into those wounds and speak for them; so, if he tell us his[2989]
    noble deeds, we must also tell him our noble acceptance of
    them. Ingratitude is monstrous: and for the multitude to
    be ingrateful, were to make a monster of the multitude; of        10
    the which we being members, should bring ourselves to be
    monstrous members.

    _First Cit._ And to make us no better thought of, a little
    help will serve; for once we stood up about the corn, he[2990]
    himself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude.[2991]     15

    _Third Cit._ We have been called so of many; not that
    our heads are some brown, some black, some auburn, some[2992]
    bald, but that our wits are so diversely coloured: and truly
    I think, if all our wits were to issue out of one skull, they[2993]
    would fly east, west, north, south, and their consent of one      20
    direct way should be at once to all the points o' the compass.[2994]

    _Sec. Cit._ Think you so? Which way do you judge my
    wit would fly?

    _Third Cit._ Nay, your wit will not so soon out as another
    man's will; 'tis strongly wedged up in a block-head; but if[2995]  25
    it were at liberty, 'twould, sure, southward.[2996]

    _Sec. Cit._ Why that way?

    _Third Cit._ To lose itself in a fog; where being three
    parts melted away with rotten dews, the fourth would return[2997]
    for conscience sake, to help to get thee a wife.                  30

    _Sec. Cit._ You are never without your tricks: you may,
    you may.[2998]

    _Third Cit._ Are you all resolved to give your voices? But
    that's no matter, the greater part carries it. I say, if he would[2999]
    incline to the people, there was never a worthier man.            35

    _Enter_ CORIOLANUS _in a gown of humility, with_ MENENIUS.[3000]

    Here he comes, and in the gown of humility: mark his behaviour.
    We are not to stay all together, but to come by him[3001]
    where he stands, by ones, by twos, and by threes. He's to[3002]
    make his requests by particulars; wherein every one of us[3003]
    has a single honour, in giving him our own voices with our        40
    own tongues: therefore follow me, and I'll direct you how
    you shall go by him.

    _All._ Content, content.                   [_Exeunt Citizens._[3004]

    _Men._ O sir, you are not right: have you not known
    The worthiest men have done 't?

    _Cor._                          What must I say?--[3005]          45
    'I pray, sir,'--Plague upon 't! I cannot bring[3005]
    My tongue to such a pace. 'Look, sir, my wounds!
    I got them in my country's service, when
    Some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran
    From the noise of our own drums.'[3006]

    _Men._                            O me, the gods![3007]           50
    You must not speak of that: you must desire them[3007]
    To think upon you.[3007]

    _Cor._             Think upon me! hang 'em!
    I would they would forget me, like the virtues[3008]
    Which our divines lose by 'em.[3008][3009]

    _Men._                         You'll mar all:
    I'll leave you: pray you, speak to 'em, I pray you,               55
    In wholesome manner.                                  [_Exit._[3010]

    _Cor._               Bid them wash their faces,
    And keep their teeth clean.        [_Re-enter two of the Citizens._]
        So, here comes a brace.

                   _Re-enter a third_ Citizen.[3011]

    You know the cause, sir, of my standing here.[3012]

    _Third Cit._ We do, sir; tell us what hath brought you[3013]
    to 't.                                                            60

    _Cor._ Mine own desert.[3014]

    _Sec. Cit._ Your own desert![3014]

    _Cor._ Ay, but not mine own desire.[3014][3015]

    _First Cit._ How! not your own desire![3014]

    _Cor._ No, sir, 'twas never my desire yet to trouble the[3014]    65
    poor with begging.[3014]

    _Third Cit._ You must think, if we give you any thing,[3013][3014]
    we hope to gain by you.[3014]

    _Cor._ Well then, I pray, your price o' the consulship?[3014][3016]

    _First Cit._ The price is, to ask it kindly.[3014][3017]          70

    _Cor._ Kindly! Sir, I pray, let me ha 't: I have wounds[3014][3018]
    to show you, which shall be yours in private. Your good[3014][3019]
    voice, sir; what say you?[3014]

    _Sec. Cit._ You shall ha' it, worthy sir.[3014]

    _Cor._ A match, sir. There's in all two worthy voices[3014]       75
    begged. I have your alms: adieu.[3014]

    _Third Cit._ But this is something odd.[3013][3014][3020]

    _Sec. Cit._ An 'twere to give again,--but 'tis no matter.[3014]

                                           [_Exeunt the three Citizens._

                  _Re-enter two other_ Citizens.[3021]

    _Cor._ Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of
    your voices that I may be consul, I have here the customary       80
    gown.

    _Fourth Cit._ You have deserved nobly of your country,[3022]
    and you have not deserved nobly.

    _Cor._ Your enigma?[3023]

    _Fourth Cit._ You have been a scourge to her enemies,[3022]       85
    you have been a rod to her friends; you have not indeed
    loved the common people.

    _Cor._ You should account me the more virtuous, that I
    have not been common in my love. I will, sir, flatter my[3024]
    sworn brother, the people, to earn a dearer estimation of[3025]   90
    them; 'tis a condition they account gentle: and since the
    wisdom of their choice is rather to have my hat than my[3026]
    heart, I will practise the insinuating nod and be off to[3027]
    them most counterfeitly; that is, sir, I will counterfeit the
    bewitchment of some popular man, and give it bountiful to[3028]   95
    the desirers. Therefore, beseech you, I may be consul.[3029]

    _Fifth Cit._ We hope to find you our friend; and therefore[3030]
    give you our voices heartily.

    _Fourth Cit._ You have received many wounds for your[3022]
    country.                                                         100

    _Cor._ I will not seal your knowledge with showing them.
    I will make much of your voices, and so trouble you no
    farther.

    _Both Cit._ The gods give you joy, sir, heartily!   [_Exeunt._[3031]

    _Cor._ Most sweet voices!                                        105
    Better it is to die, better to starve,[3032]
    Than crave the hire which first we do deserve.[3033]
    Why in this woolvish toge should I stand here,[3034][3035]
    To beg of Hob and Dick that do appear,[3034][3036][3037]
    Their needless vouches? Custom calls me to 't:[3034][3036][3038]  110
    What custom wills, in all things should we do 't,[3034][3039]
    The dust on antique time would lie unswept,[3034]
    And mountainous error be too highly heap'd[3034]
    For truth to o'er-peer. Rather than fool it so,[3034][3040]
    Let the high office and the honour go[3034]                      115
    To one that would do thus. I am half through:[3034]
    The one part suffer'd, the other will I do.[3034]

                _Re-enter three_ Citizens _more_.[3041]

    Here come moe voices.[3042]
    Your voices: for your voices I have fought;
    Watch'd for your voices; for your voices bear                    120
    Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six[3043]
    I have seen, and heard of; for your voices have[3044][3045]
    Done many things, some less, some more: your voices:[3045]
    Indeed, I would be consul.[3045][3046]

    _Sixth Cit._ He has done nobly, and cannot go without[3047]      125
    any honest man's voice.

    _Seventh Cit._ Therefore let him be consul: the gods give[3048]
    him joy, and make him good friend to the people![3049]

    _All._ Amen, amen. God save thee, noble consul!

                                                               [_Exeunt_

    _Cor._ Worthy voices!                                            130

        _Re-enter_ MENENIUS, _with_ BRUTUS _and_ SICINIUS.[3050]

    _Men._ You have stood your limitation; and the tribunes[3051][3052]
    Endue you with the people's voice: remains[3051]
    That in the official marks invested in you[3051]
    Anon do meet the senate.[3051]

    _Cor._                   Is this done?

    _Sic._ The custom of request you have discharged:                135
    The people do admit you, and are summon'd
    To meet anon upon you approbation.

    _Cor._ Where? at the senate-house?

    _Sic._                              There, Coriolanus.

    _Cor._ May I change these garments?

    _Sic._                               You may, sir.[3053]

    _Cor._ That I'll straight do, and, knowing myself again,         140
    Repair to the senate-house.

    _Men._ I'll keep you company. Will you along?

    _Bru._ We stay here for the people.

    _Sic._                              Fare you well.

                                      [_Exeunt Coriolanus and Menenius._

    He has it now; and, by his looks, methinks[3054]
    'Tis warm at's heart.[3055]

    _Bru._                With a proud heart he wore[3056]           145
    His humble weeds. Will you dismiss the people?[3056]

                       _Re-enter_ Citizens.[3057]

    _Sic._ How now, my masters! have you chose this man?

    _First Cit._ He has our voices, sir.

    _Bru._ We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.

    _Sec. Cit._ Amen, sir: to my poor unworthy notice,[3058]         150
    He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices.

    _Third Cit._                            Certainly[3059]
    He flouted us downright.[3059]

    _First Cit._ No, 'tis his kind of speech; he did not mock us.

    _Sec. Cit._ Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says[3060]
    He used us scornfully: he should have show'd us[3060]            155
    His marks of merit, wounds received for's country.[3061]

    _Sic._ Why, so he did, I am sure.[3062]

    _Citizens._ No, no; no man saw 'em.[3063]

    _Third Cit._ He said he had wounds which he could show in private;[3064]
    And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,[3065]                 160
    'I would be consul,' says he: 'aged custom,
    But by your voices, will not so permit me;
    Your voices therefore.' When we granted that,
    Here was 'I thank you for your voices: thank you:
    Your most sweet voices: now you have left your voices,           165
    I have no further with you.' Was not this mockery?[3066]

    _Sic._ Why, either were you ignorant to see't,[3067]
    Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness
    To yield your voices?

    _Bru._               Could you not have told him,
    As you were lesson'd, when he had no power,                      170
    But was a petty servant to the state,
    He was your enemy; ever spake against[3068]
    Your liberties and the charters that you bear[3069]
    I' the body of the weal: and now, arriving
    A place of potency and sway o' the state,[3070]                  175
    If he should still malignantly remain
    Fast foe to the plebeii, your voices might[3071]
    Be curses to yourselves? You should have said,
    That as his worthy deeds did claim no less
    Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature                   180
    Would think upon you for your voices and[3072][3073]
    Translate his malice towards you into love,[3073]
    Standing your friendly lord.

    _Sic._                       Thus to have said,
    As you were fore-advised, had touch'd his spirit
    And tried his inclination; from him pluck'd                      185
    Either his gracious promise, which you might,
    As cause had call'd you up, have held him to;
    Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature,
    Which easily endures not article[3074]
    Tying him to aught: so, putting him to rage,[3074]               190
    You should have ta'en the advantage of his choler,
    And pass'd him unelected.

    _Bru._                    Did you perceive
    He did solicit you in free contempt[3075]
    When he did need your loves; and do you think[3075]
    That his contempt shall not be bruising to you                   195
    When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies[3076]
    No heart among you? or had you tongues to cry
    Against the rectorship of judgement?

    _Sic._                               Have you,[3077]
    Ere now, denied the asker? and now again,[3077]
    Of him that did not ask but mock, bestow[3077][3078]             200
    Your sued-for tongues?[3077][3079]

    _Third Cit._ He's not confirm'd; we may deny him yet.[3079]

    _Sec. Cit._ And will deny him:[3080]
    I'll have five hundred voices of that sound.[3081]

    _First Cit._ I twice five hundred, and their friends to
            piece 'em.[3082]  205

    _Bru._ Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends,
    They have chose a consul that will from them take[3083]
    Their liberties, make them of no more voice
    Than dogs that are as often beat for barking
    As therefore kept to do so.[3084]

    _Sic._                      Let them assemble;[3085]             210
    And, on a safer judgement, all revoke[3085][3086]
    Your ignorant election: enforce his pride[3085][3086]
    And his old hate unto you: besides, forget not[3086][3087]
    With what contempt he wore the humble weed,
    How in his suit he scorn'd you: but your loves,                  215
    Thinking upon his services, took from you
    The apprehension of his present portance,
    Which most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion[3088]
    After the inveterate hate he bears you.[3089]

    _Bru._                                  Lay[3090][3091][3092]
    A fault on us, your tribunes; that we labour'd,[3090]            220
    No impediment between, but that you must[3090]
    Cast your election on him.[3090]

    _Sic._                    Say, you chose him[3090]
    More after our commandment than as guided[3090][3092]
    By your own true affections; and that your minds,[3090][3092]
    Pre-occupied with what you rather must do[3090]                  225
    Than what you should, made you against the grain[3090][3092][3093]
    To voice him consul: lay the fault on us.[3090]

    _Bru._ Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you,
    How youngly he began to serve his country,
    How long continued; and what stock he springs of,                230
    The noble house o' the Marcians, from whence came[3094]
    That Ancus Marcius, Numa's daughter's son,
    Who, after great Hostilius, here was king;
    Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,
    That our best water brought by conduits hither;[3095]            235
    And [Censorinus] nobly named so,[3095]
    Twice being [by the people chosen] censor,[3095]
    Was his great ancestor.[3095]

    _Sic._                  One thus descended,
    That hath beside well in his person wrought[3096]
    To be set high in place, we did commend                          240
    To your remembrances: but you have found,
    Scaling his present bearing with his past,[3097]
    That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke
    Your sudden approbation.

    _Bru._                   Say, you ne'er had done't--[3098]
    Harp on that still--but by our putting on:                       245
    And presently, when you have drawn your number,
    Repair to the Capitol.

    _Citizens._             We will so: almost all[3099][3100]
    Repent in their election.                  [_Exeunt Citizens._[3099]

    _Bru._                    Let them go on;[3101]
    This mutiny were better put in hazard,
    Than stay, past doubt, for greater:                              250
    If, as his nature is, he fall in rage
    With their refusal, both observe and answer
    The vantage of his anger.

    _Sic._                    To the Capitol, come:[3102]
    We will be there before the stream o' the people;
    And this shall seem, as partly 'tis, their own,                  255
    Which we have goaded onward.                              [_Exeunt._

ACT III.

   _Cornets. Enter_ CORIOLANUS, MENENIUS, _all the_ Gentry, COMINIUS,
               TITUS LARTIUS, _and other_ Senators.[3103]

    _Cor._ Tullus Aufidius then had made new head?

    _Lart._ He had, my lord; and that it was which caused
    Our swifter composition.

    _Cor._ So then the Volsces stand but as at first;
    Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road[3104]             5
    Upon's again.

    _Com._        They are worn, lord consul, so,[3105]
    That we shall hardly in our ages see
    Their banners wave again.

    _Cor._                       Saw you Aufidius?

    _Lart._ On safe-guard he came to me; and did curse
    Against the Volsces, for they had so vilely                       10
    Yielded the town: he is retired to Antium.

    _Cor._ Spoke he of me?

    _Lart._                He did, my lord.

    _Cor._                                  How? what?

    _Lart._ How often he had met you, sword to sword;
    That of all things upon the earth he hated
    Your person most; that he would pawn his fortunes                 15
    To hopeless restitution, so he might
    Be call'd your vanquisher.

    _Cor._                     At Antium lives he?

    _Lart._ At Antium.

    _Cor._ I wish I had a cause to seek him there,
    To oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home.[3106]                   20

                     _Enter_ SICINIUS _and_ BRUTUS.

    Behold, these are the tribunes of the people,
    The tongues o' the common mouth: I do despise them;
    For they do prank them in authority,
    Against all noble sufferance.

    _Sic._                        Pass no further.

    _Cor._ Ha! what is that?                                          25

    _Bru._ It will be dangerous to go on: no further.

    _Cor._ What makes this change?

    _Men._ The matter?

    _Com._ Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common?[3107]

    _Bru._ Cominius, no.

    _Cor._               Have I had children's voices?                30

    _First Sen._ Tribunes, give way; he shall to the market-place.[3108]

    _Bru._ The people are incensed against him.

    _Sic._                                                 Stop,[3109]
    Or all will fall in broil.[3109]

    _Cor._                     Are these your herd?[3110]
    Must these have voices, that can yield them now,
    And straight disclaim their tongues? What are your offices?[3111]  35
    You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth?
    Have you not set them on?

    _Men._                    Be calm, be calm.

    _Cor._ It is a purposed thing, and grows by plot,
    To curb the will of the nobility:
    Suffer 't, and live with such as cannot rule,                     40
    Nor ever will be ruled.

    _Bru._                  Call't not a plot:
    The people cry you mock'd them; and of late,
    When corn was given them gratis, you repined,
    Scandal'd the suppliants for the people, call'd them[3112]
    Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.                     45

    _Cor._ Why, this was known before.

    _Bru._                             Not to them all.

    _Cor._ Have you inform'd them sithence?[3113]

    _Bru._                                  How! I inform them!

    _Com._ You are like to do such business.[3114]

    _Bru._                                   Not unlike,[3115]
    Each way, to better yours.[3115][3116]

    _Cor._ Why then should I be consul? By yond clouds,               50
    Let me deserve so ill as you, and make me
    Your fellow tribune.

    _Sic._               You show too much of that
    For which the people stir: if you will pass
    To where you are bound, you must inquire your way,[3117]
    Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit;                      55
    Or never be so noble as a consul,[3118]
    Nor yoke with him for tribune.

    _Men._                         Let's be calm.

    _Com._ The people are abused; set on. This paltering[3119]
    Becomes not Rome; nor has Coriolanus[3120]
    Deserved this so dishonour'd rub, laid falsely                    60
    I' the plain way of his merit.

    _Cor._                         Tell me of corn![3121]
    This was my speech, and I will speak 't again--[3121]

    _Men._ Not now, not now.

    _First Sen._             Not in this heat, sir, now.

    _Cor._ Now, as I live, I will. My nobler friends,[3122][3123]
    I crave their pardons:[3122]                                      65
    For the mutable, rank-scented many, let them[3122][3124]
    Regard me as I do not flatter, and[3122]
    Therein behold themselves: I say again,[3122][3125]
    In soothing them, we nourish 'gainst our senate
    The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,                     70
    Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd and scatter'd,[3126]
    By mingling them with us, the honour'd number;
    Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that
    Which they have given to beggars.[3127]

    _Men._                            Well, no more.

    _First Sen._ No more words, we beseech you.

    _Cor._                                      How! no more!         75
    As for my country I have shed my blood,
    Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs
    Coin words till their decay against those measles,
    Which we disdain should tetter us, yet sought[3128]
    The very way to catch them.

    _Bru._                      You speak o' the people,[3129][3130]  80
    As if you were a god to punish, not[3129][3131]
    A man of their infirmity.[3129][3132]

    _Sic._                    'Twere well[3129]
    We let the people know't.[3129]

    _Men._                    What, what? his choler?[3129]

    _Cor._ Choler![3129]
    Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,[3129]                    85
    By Jove, 'twould be my mind![3133]

    _Sic._                       It is a mind[3133]
    That shall remain a poison where it is,[3133]
    Not poison any further.[3133]

    _Cor._                  Shall remain![3133]
    Hear you this Triton of the minnows? mark you[3134]
    His absolute 'shall'?

    _Com._                'Twas from the canon.[3135]

    _Cor._                                      'Shall'![3136]        90
    O good, but most unwise patricians! why,[3136][3137]
    You grave but reckless senators, have you thus[3138]
    Given Hydra here to choose an officer,[3139]
    That with his peremptory 'shall,' being but
    The horn and noise o' the monster's, wants not spirit[3140]       95
    To say he'll turn your current in a ditch,
    And make your channel his? If he have power,[3141]
    Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake[3141][3142][3143][3144]
    Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,[3141][3143][3145]
    Be not as common fools; if you are not,[3141][3146]              100
    Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,[3141][3147]
    If they be senators: and they are no less,
    When, both your voices blended, the great'st taste[3148]
    Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate;[3149]
    And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'                      105
    His popular 'shall,' against a graver bench
    Than ever frown'd in Greece. By Jove himself,
    It makes the consuls base! and my soul aches
    To know, when two authorities are up,
    Neither supreme, how soon confusion                              110
    May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take
    The one by the other.

    _Com._                Well, on to the market-place.

    _Cor._ Whoever gave that counsel, to give forth[3150]
    The corn o' the storehouse gratis, as 'twas used[3151]
    Sometime in Greece,--[3152]

    _Men._                Well, well, no more of that.               115

    _Cor._ Though there the people had more absolute power,
    I say, they nourish'd disobedience, fed[3153][3154]
    The ruin of the state.[3153]

    _Bru._                 Why, shall the people give[3155]
    One that speaks thus their voice?

    _Cor._                            I'll give my reasons,
    More worthier than their voices. They know the corn[3156]        120
    Was not our recompense, resting well assured[3157]
    They ne'er did service for't: being press'd to the war,
    Even when the navel of the state was touch'd,
    They would not thread the gates. This kind of service
    Did not deserve corn gratis: being i' the war,                   125
    Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd[3158]
    Most valour, spoke not for them: the accusation
    Which they have often made against the senate,
    All cause unborn, could never be the native[3159]
    Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?[3160]                 130
    How shall this bisson multitude digest[3161]
    The senate's courtesy? Let deeds express
    What's like to be their words: 'We did request it;
    We are the greater poll, and in true fear[3162]
    They gave us our demands.' Thus we debase[3163]                  135
    The nature of our seats, and make the rabble
    Call our cares fears; which will in time[3164][3165]
    Break ope the locks o' the senate, and bring in[3164][3166]
    The crows to peck the eagles.[3164]

    _Men._                        Come, enough.[3167]

    _Bru._ Enough, with over measure.

    _Cor._                            No, take more:                 140
    What may be sworn by, both divine and human,[3168]
    Seal what I end withal! This double worship,
    Where one part does disdain with cause, the other[3169]
    Insult without all reason; where gentry, title, wisdom,[3170]
    Cannot conclude but by the yea and no                            145
    Of general ignorance,--it must omit[3171]
    Real necessities, and give way the while
    To unstable slightness: purpose so barr'd, it follows,[3172][3173]
    Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you,--[3173]
    You that will be less fearful than discreet;                     150
    That love the fundamental part of state
    More than you doubt the change on 't; that prefer[3174]
    A noble life before a long, and wish
    To jump a body with a dangerous physic[3175]
    That's sure of death without it,--at once pluck out[3176]        155
    The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick
    The sweet which is their poison. Your dishonour
    Mangles true judgement and bereaves the state
    Of that integrity which should become 't;[3177]
    Not having the power to do the good it would,                    160
    For the ill which doth control 't.

    _Bru._                             Has said enough.[3178]

    _Sic._ Has spoken like a traitor, and shall answer[3179]
    As traitors do.

    _Cor._ Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee!
    What should the people do with these bald tribunes?              165
    On whom depending, their obedience fails
    To the greater bench: in a rebellion,[3180]
    When what's not meet, but what must be, was law,[3181]
    Then were they chosen: in a better hour,
    Let what is meet be said it must be meet,[3182]                  170
    And throw their power i' the dust.

    _Bru._ Manifest treason!

    _Sic._                 This a consul? no.

    _Bru._ The ædiles, ho!

                        _Enter an_ Ædile.[3183]

                           Let him be apprehended.

    _Sic._ Go, call the people: [_Exit Ædile_] in whose name myself[3184]
    Attach thee as a traitorous innovator,                           175
    A foe to the public weal: obey, I charge thee,
    And follow to thine answer.

    _Cor._                      Hence, old goat!

    _Senators, &c._ We'll surety him.

    _Com._                            Aged sir, hands off.[3185]

    _Cor._ Hence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bones
    Out of thy garments.

    _Sic._               Help, ye citizens!                          180

         _Enter a rabble of_ Citizens, _with the_ Ædiles.[3186]

    _Men._ On both sides more respect.[3187]

    _Sic._ Here's he that would take from you all your power.

    _Bru._ Seize him, ædiles!

    _Citizens._ Down with him! down with him![3188]

    _Senators, &c._ Weapons, weapons, weapons!                       185

                      [_They all bustle about Coriolanus, crying_,[3189]

    'Tribunes!' 'Patricians!' 'Citizens!' 'What, ho!'
    'Sicinius!' 'Brutus!' 'Coriolanus!' 'Citizens!'
    'Peace, peace, peace!' 'Stay! hold! peace!'[3190]

    _Men._ What is about to be? I am out of breath.
    Confusion's near. I cannot speak. You, tribunes[3191]            190
    To the people! Coriolanus, patience![3192][3193]
    Speak, good Sicinius.[3193][3194]

    _Sic._                Hear me, people; peace!

    _Citizens._ Let's hear our tribune: peace!--Speak, speak, speak.[3195]

    _Sic._ You are at point to lose your liberties:
    Marcius would have all from you; Marcius,                        195
    Whom late you have named for consul.[3196]

    _Men._                               Fie, fie, fie![3197]
    This is the way to kindle, not to quench.[3197]

    _First Sen._ To unbuild the city, and to lay all flat.[3198]

    _Sic._ What is the city but the people?

    _Citizens._                             True,[3199]
    The people are the city.[3199]                                   200

    _Bru._ By the consent of all, we were establish'd[3200]
    The people's magistrates.[3200]

    _Citizens._               You so remain.

    _Men._ And so are like to do.

    _Com._ That is the way to lay the city flat,[3201]
    To bring the roof to the foundation,                             205
    And bury all which yet distinctly ranges,
    In heaps and piles of ruin.

    _Sic._                      This deserves death.

    _Bru._ Or let us stand to our authority,
    Or let us lose it. We do here pronounce,
    Upon the part o' the people, in whose power                      210
    We were elected theirs, Marcius is worthy
    Of present death.

    _Sic._            Therefore lay hold of him;[3202]
    Bear him to the rock Tarpeian, and from thence
    Into destruction cast him.

    _Bru._                     Ædiles, seize him!

    _Citizens._ Yield, Marcius, yield![3203]

    _Men._                             Hear me one word;[3204]       215
    Beseech you, tribunes, hear me but a word.[3204][3205]

    _Ædiles._ Peace, peace!

    _Men._ [_To Brutus_] Be that you seem, truly your country's friend,[3206]
    And temperately proceed to what you would
    Thus violently redress.

    _Bru._                  Sir, those cold ways,                    220
    That seem like prudent helps, are very poisonous[3207]
    Where the disease is violent. Lay hands upon him,[3208]
    And bear him to the rock.

    _Cor._                  No, I'll die here. [_Drawing his sword._[3209]
    There's some among you have beheld me fighting:
    Come, try upon yourselves what you have seen me.[3210]           225

    _Men._ Down with that sword! Tribunes, withdraw awhile.

    _Bru._ Lay hands upon him.

    _Men._                          Help Marcius, help,[3211][3212]
    You that be noble; help him, young and old![3212]

    _Citizens._ Down with him, down with him!

                            [_In this mutiny, the Tribunes, the Ædiles,
                                    and the People, are beat in._[3213]

    _Men._ Go, get you to your house; be gone, away![3214]           230
    All will be naught else.

    _Sec. Sen._              Get you gone.

    _Com._                                 Stand fast;[3215][3216]
    We have as many friends as enemies.[3216]

    _Men._ Shall it be put to that?

    _First Sen._                    The gods forbid![3217]
    I prithee, noble friend, home to thy house;
    Leave us to cure this cause.

    _Men._                       For 'tis a sore upon us[3218]       235
    You cannot tent yourself: be gone, beseech you.

    _Com._ Come, sir, along with us.[3219]

    _Cor._ I would they were barbarians--as they are,[3220]
    Though in Rome litter'd--not Romans--as they are not,[3220]
    Though calved i' the porch o' the Capitol,--[3220]

    _Men._                                       Be gone:[3220][3221][3222]  240
    Put not your worthy rage into your tongue:[3220][3222]
    One time will owe another.[3220][3223]

    _Cor._                     On fair ground[3224]
    I could beat forty of them.[3224]

    _Men._                      I could myself[3225]
    Take up a brace o' the best of them; yea, the two tribunes.[3225][3226]

    _Com._ But now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic;                      245
    And manhood is call'd foolery, when it stands
    Against a falling fabric. Will you hence
    Before the tag return? whose rage doth rend
    Like interrupted waters, and o'erbear
    What they are used to bear.

    _Men._                      Pray you, be gone:                   250
    I'll try whether my old wit be in request[3227]
    With those that have but little: this must be patch'd
    With cloth of any colour.

    _Com._                    Nay, come away.

                       [_Exeunt Coriolanus, Cominius, and others._[3228]

    _First Patrician._ This man has marr'd his fortune.[3229]

    _Men._ His nature is too noble for the world:                    255
    He would not flatter Neptune for his trident,
    Or Jove for 's power to thunder. His heart's his mouth:[3230]
    What his breast forges, that his tongue must vent;
    And, being angry, does forget that ever
    He heard the name of death.                  [_A noise within._  260
    Here's goodly work!

    _Sec. Pat._         I would they were a-bed![3231]

    _Men._ I would they were in Tiber! What, the vengeance,[3232]
    Could he not speak 'em fair?[3232]

       _Re-enter_ BRUTUS _and_ SICINIUS, _with the rabble_.[3233]

    _Sic._                       Where is this viper,
    That would depopulate the city, and[3234][3235]
    Be every man himself?[3234]

    _Men._                    You worthy tribunes--[3236]            265

    _Sic._ He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock
    With rigorous hands: he hath resisted law,
    And therefore law shall scorn him further trial
    Than the severity of the public power,[3237]
    Which he so sets at nought.

    _First Cit._                He shall well know[3238]             270
    The noble tribunes are the people's mouths,[3238]
    And we their hands.[3238]

    _Citizens._ He shall, sure on't.[3239]

    _Men._                           Sir, sir,--[3240]

    _Sic._ Peace!

    _Men._ Do not cry havoc, where you should but hunt[3241]         275
    With modest warrant.

    _Sic._               Sir, how comes 't that you[3242][3243]
    Have holp to make this rescue?[3242]

    _Men._                         Hear me speak:[3244]
    As I do know the consul's worthiness,[3244]
    So can I name his faults,--[3244]

    _Sic._                      Consul! what consul?

    _Men._ The consul Coriolanus.

    _Bru._                             He consul![3245]              280

    _Citizens._ No, no, no, no, no.[3239]

    _Men._ If, by the tribunes' leave, and yours, good people,[3246]
    I may be heard, I would crave a word or two;[3247]
    The which shall turn you to no further harm
    Than so much loss of time.

    _Sic._                     Speak briefly then;                   285
    For we are peremptory to dispatch
    This viperous traitor: to eject him hence[3248]
    Were but one danger, and to keep him here[3249]
    Our certain death: therefore it is decreed
    He dies to-night.

    _Men._            Now the good gods forbid                       290
    That our renowned Rome, whose gratitude
    Towards her deserved children is enroll'd[3250]
    In Jove's own book, like an unnatural dam
    Should now eat up her own!

    _Sic._ He's a disease that must be cut away.                     295

    _Men._ O, he's a limb that has but a disease;
    Mortal, to cut it off; to cure it, easy.
    What has he done to Rome that's worthy death?
    Killing our enemies, the blood he hath lost--[3251]
    Which, I dare vouch, is more than that he hath                   300
    By many an ounce--he dropp'd it for his country;
    And what is left, to lose it by his country
    Were to us all that do 't and suffer it[3252]
    A brand to the end o' the world.

    _Sic._                           This is clean kam.[3253]

    _Bru._ Merely awry: when he did love his country,[3254]          305
    It honour'd him.[3254]

    _Men._           The service of the foot[3255][3256]
    Being once gangrened, is not then respected[3256][3257]
    For what before it was.[3258]

    _Bru._                  We'll hear no more.
    Pursue him to his house, and pluck him thence;
    Lest his infection, being of catching nature,[3259]              310
    Spread further.

    _Men._          One word more, one word.[3260]
    This tiger-footed rage, when it shall find
    The harm of unscann'd swiftness, will, too late,
    Tie leaden pounds to 's heels. Proceed by process;[3261]
    Lest parties, as he is beloved, break out,                       315
    And sack great Rome with Romans.

    _Bru._                           If it were so--[3262]

    _Sic._ What do ye talk?
    Have we not had a taste of his obedience?
    Our ædiles smote? ourselves resisted? Come.[3263]

    _Men._ Consider this: he has been bred i' the wars[3264]         320
    Since he could draw a sword, and is ill school'd[3265]
    In bolted language; meal and bran together
    He throws without distinction. Give me leave,
    I'll go to him, and undertake to bring him[3266][3267]
    Where he shall answer, by a lawful form,[3267]                   325
    In peace, to his utmost peril.[3267]

    _First Sen._                   Noble tribunes,
    It is the humane way: the other course[3268]
    Will prove too bloody; and the end of it
    Unknown to the beginning.

    _Sic._                    Noble Menenius,[3269]
    Be you then as the people's officer.[3269]                       330
    Masters, lay down your weapons.

    _Bru._                          Go not home.

    _Sic._ Meet on the market-place. We'll attend you there:[3270]
    Where, if you bring not Marcius, we'll proceed
    In our first way.

    _Men._            I'll bring him to you.[3271][3272]
    [_To the Senators_] Let me desire your company: he must
                come,[3272][3273]  335
    Or what is worst will follow.

    _First Sen._                  Pray you, let's to him. [_Exeunt._[3274]


SCENE II. _A room in Coriolanus's house._

              _Enter_ CORIOLANUS _with_ Patricians.[3275]

    _Cor._ Let them pull all about mine ears; present me
    Death on the wheel, or at wild horses' heels;
    Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock,
    That the precipitation might down stretch
    Below the beam of sight; yet will I still                          5
    Be thus to them.

    _A Patrician._   You do the nobler.[3276]

    _Cor._ I muse my mother[3277]
    Does not approve me further, who was wont[3278]
    To call them woollen vassals, things created[3279]
    To buy and sell with groats, to show bare heads                   10
    In congregations, to yawn, be still and wonder,[3280]
    When one but of my ordinance stood up
    To speak of peace or war.

                           _Enter_ VOLUMNIA.

                              I talk of you:[3281]
    Why did you wish me milder? would you have me
    False to my nature? Rather say, I play[3282]                      15
    The man I am.[3282]

    _Vol._        O, sir, sir, sir,[3283]
    I would have had you put your power well on,
    Before you had worn it out.

    _Cor._                      Let go.[3284]

    _Vol._ You might have been enough the man you are,
    With striving less to be so: lesser had been[3285]                20
    The thwartings of your dispositions, if[3286]
    You had not show'd them how ye were disposed[3287]
    Ere they lack'd power to cross you.

    _Cor._                              Let them hang.

    _Vol._ Ay, and burn too.

                 _Enter_ MENENIUS _with the_ Senators.

    _Men._ Come, come, you have been too rough,
            something too rough;[3288][3289]  25
    You must return and mend it.[3288]

    _First Sen._                 There's no remedy;[3290]
    Unless, by not so doing, our good city
    Cleave in the midst, and perish.

    _Vol._                           Pray, be counsell'd:
    I have a heart as little apt as yours,[3291]
    But yet a brain that leads my use of anger                        30
    To better vantage.

    _Men._             Well said, noble woman!
    Before he should thus stoop to the herd, but that[3292]
    The violent fit o' the time craves it as physic[3293]
    For the whole state, I would put mine armour on,[3294]
    Which I can scarcely bear.

    _Cor._                     What must I do?[3295]                  35

    _Men._ Return to the tribunes.[3295]

    _Cor._                         Well, what then? what then?[3295]

    _Men._ Repent what you have spoke.[3295]

    _Cor._ For them! I cannot do it to the gods;[3296]
    Must I then do't to them?

    _Vol._                    You are too absolute;
    Though therein you can never be too noble,                        40
    But when extremities speak. I have heard you say,[3297]
    Honour and policy, like unsever'd friends,
    I' the war do grow together: grant that, and tell me,
    In peace what each of them by the other lose,[3298]
    That they combine not there.

    _Cor._                       Tush, tush!

    _Men._                                   A good demand.           45

    _Vol._ If it be honour in your wars to seem
    The same you are not, which, for your best ends,
    You adopt your policy, how is it less or worse,[3299]
    That it shall hold companionship in peace
    With honour, as in war, since that to both[3300]                  50
    It stands in like request?

    _Cor._                     Why force you this?

    _Vol._ Because that now it lies you on to speak[3301][3302]
    To the people; not by your own instruction,[3301]
    Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you,[3301][3303]
    But with such words that are but roted in[3301][3304]             55
    Your tongue, though but bastards and syllables[3301][3305]
    Of no allowance to your bosom's truth.[3306]
    Now, this no more dishonours you at all
    Than to take in a town with gentle words,
    Which else would put you to your fortune and                      60
    The hazard of much blood.
    I would dissemble with my nature, where
    My fortunes and my friends at stake required
    I should do so in honour. I am in this,[3307]
    Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;[3308]            65
    And you will rather show our general louts
    How you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em,
    For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard
    Of what that want might ruin.

    _Men._                        Noble lady![3309]
    Come, go with us; speak fair: you may salve so,                   70
    Not what is dangerous present, but the loss[3310]
    Of what is past.

    _Vol._           I prithee now, my son,
    Go to them, with this bonnet in thy hand;[3311]
    And thus far having stretch'd it--here be with them--[3312][3313]
    Thy knee bussing the stones--for in such business[3312]           75
    Action is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorant
    More learned than the ears--waving thy head,[3314][3315][3316]
    Which often, thus, correcting thy stout heart,[3314][3316][3317][3318][3319]
    Now humble as the ripest mulberry[3318][3320]
    That will not hold the handling: or say to them,[3320][3321]      80
    Thou art their soldier, and being bred in broils
    Hast not the soft way which, thou dost confess,
    Were fit for thee to use, as they to claim,[3322]
    In asking their good loves; but thou wilt frame
    Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far                       85
    As thou hast power and person.

    _Men._                         This but done,
    Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;[3323]
    For they have pardons, being ask'd, as free
    As words to little purpose.

    _Vol._                      Prithee now,
    Go, and be ruled: although I know thou hadst rather[3324]         90
    Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf
    Than flatter him in a bower.

                           _Enter_ COMINIUS.

                                 Here is Cominius.

    _Com._ I have been i' the market-place; and, sir, 'tis fit[3325]
    You make strong party, or defend yourself[3326]
    By calmness or by absence: all's in anger.                        95

    _Men._ Only fair speech.

    _Com._                        I think 'twill serve, if he[3327]
    Can thereto frame his spirit.[3327]

    _Vol._                        He must, and will.
    Prithee now, say you will, and go about it.

    _Cor._ Must I go show them my unbarb'd sconce? must I,[3328][3329]
    With my base tongue, give to my noble heart[3329]                100
    A lie, that it must bear? Well, I will do't:[3330]
    Yet, were there but this single plot to lose,[3331]
    This mould of Marcius, they to dust should grind it,[3332]
    And throw't against the wind. To the market-place!
    You have put me now to such a part, which never[3333]            105
    I shall discharge to the life.

    _Com._                         Come, come, we'll prompt you.

    _Vol._ I prithee now, sweet son, as thou hast said[3334]
    My praises made thee first a soldier, so,
    To have my praise for this, perform a part
    Thou hast not done before.

    _Cor._                     Well, I must do't:                    110
    Away, my disposition, and possess me
    Some harlot's spirit! my throat of war be turn'd,
    Which quired with my drum, into a pipe[3335]
    Small as an eunuch, or the virgin voice[3336]
    That babies lulls asleep! the smiles of knaves[3337]             115
    Tent in my cheeks, and schoolboys' tears take up
    The glasses of my sight! a beggar's tongue[3338]
    Make motion through my lips, and my arm'd knees,
    Who bow'd but in my stirrup, bend like his[3339]
    That hath received an alms! I will not do't;                     120
    Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth,
    And by my body's action teach my mind
    A most inherent baseness.

    _Vol._                    At thy choice then:
    To beg of thee, it is my more dishonour
    Than thou of them. Come all to ruin: let                         125
    Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear
    Thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death
    With as big heart as thou. Do as thou list.
    Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me,[3340]
    But owe thy pride thyself.[3341]

    _Cor._                     Pray, be content:                     130
    Mother, I am going to the market-place;[3342]
    Chide me no more. I'll mountebank their loves,
    Cog their hearts from them and come home beloved
    Of all the trades in Rome. Look, I am going:
    Commend me to my wife. I'll return consul;                       135
    Or never trust to what my tongue can do
    I' the way of flattery further.

    _Vol._                          Do your will.         [_Exit._[3343]

    _Com._ Away! the tribunes do attend you: arm yourself
    To answer mildly; for they are prepared[3344]
    With accusations, as I hear, more strong                         140
    Than are upon you yet.

    _Cor._ The word is 'mildly.' Pray you, let us go:
    Let them accuse me by invention, I
    Will answer in mine honour.

    _Men._                      Ay, but mildly.

    _Cor._ Well, mildly be it then. Mildly!        [_Exeunt._[3345]  145


SCENE III. _The same. The Forum._[3346]

                     _Enter_ SICINIUS _and_ BRUTUS.

    _Bru._ In this point charge him home, that he affects
    Tyrannical power: if he evade us there,[3347]
    Enforce him with his envy to the people;
    And that the spoil got on the Antiates
    Was ne'er distributed.[3348]                                       5

                        _Enter an_ Ædile.[3349]

    What, will he come?[3348]

    _Æd._               He's coming.

    _Bru._                           How accompanied?

    _Æd._ With old Menenius and those senators
    That always favour'd him.

    _Sic._                    Have you a catalogue
    Of all the voices that we have procured,[3350]
    Set down by the poll?[3350][3351]

    _Æd._                 I have; 'tis ready.                         10

    _Sic._ Have you collected them by tribes?

    _Æd._                                      I have.[3352]

    _Sic._ Assemble presently the people hither:
    And when they hear me say 'It shall be so
    I' the right and strength o' the commons,' be it either[3353]
    For death, for fine, or banishment, then let them,                15
    If I say fine, cry 'Fine,' if death, cry 'Death,'
    Insisting on the old prerogative[3354]
    And power i' the truth o' the cause.

    _Æd._                                I shall inform them.[3355]

    _Bru._ And when such time they have begun to cry,
    Let them not cease, but with a din confused                       20
    Enforce the present execution
    Of what we chance to sentence.

    _Æd._                          Very well.

    _Sic._ Make them be strong, and ready for this hint,
    When we shall hap to give't them.

    _Bru._                             Go about it. [_Exit Ædile._[3356]
    Put him to choler straight: he hath been used                     25
    Ever to conquer and to have his worth[3357][3358][3359]
    Of contradiction: being once chafed, he cannot[3358]
    Be rein'd again to temperance; then he speaks
    What's in his heart; and that is there which looks[3360]
    With us to break his neck.

    _Sic._                     Well, here he comes.                   30

  _Enter_ CORIOLANUS, MENENIUS, _and_ COMINIUS, _with_ Senators _and_
                           Patricians.[3361]

    _Men._ Calmly, I do beseech you.

    _Cor._ Ay, as an ostler, that for the poorest piece[3362]
    Will bear the knave by the volume. The honour'd gods[3363][3364]
    Keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice[3364]
    Supplied with worthy men! plant love among's![3364][3365]         35
    Throng our large temples with the shows of peace,[3364][3366]
    And not our streets with war![3364]

    _First Sen._                  Amen, amen.

    _Men._ A noble wish.

                _Re-enter_ Ædile, _with_ Citizens.[3367]

    _Sic._ Draw near, ye people.

    _Æd._ List to your tribunes; audience: peace, I say![3368]        40

    _Cor._ First, hear me speak.

    _Both Tri._                   Well, say. Peace, ho![3369]

    _Cor._ Shall I be charged no further than this present?
    Must all determine here?

    _Sic._                   I do demand,
    If you submit you to the people's voices,
    Allow their officers, and are content                             45
    To suffer lawful censure for such faults
    As shall be proved upon you?

    _Cor._                       I am content.

    _Men._ Lo, citizens, he says he is content:
    The warlike service he has done, consider; think[3370]
    Upon the wounds his body bears, which show[3370]                  50
    Like graves i' the holy churchyard.[3371]

    _Cor._                              Scratches with briers,[3372]
    Scars to move laughter only.[3372]

    _Men._                       Consider further,
    That when he speaks not like a citizen,
    You find him like a soldier: do not take
    His rougher accents for malicious sounds,[3373]                   55
    But, as I say, such as become a soldier
    Rather than envy you.

    _Com._                Well, well, no more.[3374]

    _Cor._ What is the matter[3375]
    That being pass'd for consul with full voice,
    I am so dishonour'd that the very hour[3376]                      60
    You take it off again?

    _Sic._                 Answer to us.

    _Cor._ Say, then: 'tis true, I ought so.

    _Sic._ We charge you, that you have contrived to take
    From Rome all season'd office and to wind
    Yourself into a power tyrannical;[3377]                           65
    For which you are a traitor to the people.

    _Cor._ How! traitor!

    _Men._               Nay, temperately; your promise.

    _Cor._ The fires i' the lowest hell fold-in the people![3378]
    Call me their traitor! Thou injurious tribune!
    Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths,[3379]               70
    In thy hands clutch'd as many millions, in[3379]
    Thy lying tongue both numbers, I would say[3380]
    'Thou liest' unto thee with a voice as free
    As I do pray the gods.

    _Sic._                 Mark you this, people?[3381]

    _Citizens._ To the rock, to the rock with him![3382][3383]

    _Sic._                                          Peace!            75
    We need not put new matter to his charge:
    What you have seen him do and heard him speak,
    Beating your officers, cursing yourselves,
    Opposing laws with strokes, and here defying
    Those whose great power must try him; even this,[3384]            80
    So criminal and in such capital kind,[3384]
    Deserves the extremest death.

    _Bru._                        But since he hath[3385]
    Served well for Rome--[3385][3386]

    _Cor._                 What do you prate of service?

    _Bru._ I talk of that, that know it.[3387]

    _Cor._ You?[3387]                                                 85

    _Men._ Is this the promise that you made your mother?[3387][3388]

    _Com._ Know, I pray you,--[3387]

    _Cor._                      I'll know no further:[3389]
    Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death,
    Vagabond exile, flaying, pent to linger[3390]
    But with a grain a day, I would not buy                           90
    Their mercy at the price of one fair word,
    Nor check my courage for what they can give,[3391]
    To have't with saying 'Good morrow.'

    _Sic._                                For that he has,
    As much as in him lies, from time to time
    Envied against the people, seeking means[3392]                    95
    To pluck away their power, as now at last[3393]
    Given hostile strokes, and that not in the presence[3394]
    Of dreaded justice, but on the ministers[3395]
    That do distribute it; in the name o' the people,[3353][3396]
    And in the power of us the tribunes, we,                         100
    Even from this instant, banish him our city,
    In peril of precipitation
    From off the rock Tarpeian, never more
    To enter our Rome gates: i' the people's name,[3397]
    I say it shall be so.                                            105

    _Citizens._ It shall be so, it shall be so; let him away:[3382]
    He's banish'd, and it shall be so.[3398]

    _Com._ Hear me, my masters, and my common friends,--[3399]

    _Sic._ He's sentenced; no more hearing.

    _Com._                                   Let me speak:
    I have been consul, and can show for Rome[3400]                  110
    Her enemies' marks upon me. I do love
    My country's good with a respect more tender,[3401]
    More holy and profound, than mine own life,
    My dear wife's estimate, her womb's increase[3402]

    Speak that--[3403]

    _Sic._       We know your drift:--speak what?

    As reek o' the rotten fens, whose loves I prize
    As the dead carcasses of unburied men
    That do corrupt my air, I banish you;
    And here remain with your uncertainty!                           125
    Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts!
    Your enemies, with nodding of their plumes,
    Fan you into despair! Have the power still
    To banish your defenders; till at length
    Your ignorance, which finds not till it feels,                   130
    Making not reservation of yourselves,[3405]
    Still your own foes, deliver you as most[3406][3407]
    Abated captives to some nation[3407]
    That won you without blows! Despising,[3408]
    For you, the city, thus I turn my back:[3408][3409]              135
    There is a world elsewhere.

[_Exeunt Coriolanus, Cominius, Menenius, Senators and Patricians._[3410]

    _Æd._ The people's enemy is gone, is gone!

    _Citizens._ Our enemy is banish'd! he is gone! Hoo! hoo!

                       [_They all shout, and throw up their caps._[3411]

    _Sic._ Go, see him out at gates, and follow him,
    As he hath follow'd you, with all despite;[3412]                 140
    Give him deserved vexation. Let a guard[3412]
    Attend us through the city.

    _Citizens._ Come, come, let's see him out at gates; come.[3382][3413]
    The gods preserve our noble tribunes! Come.               [_Exeunt._

ACT IV.


SCENE I. _Rome. Before a gate of the city._

      _Enter_ CORIOLANUS, VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, MENENIUS, COMINIUS,
                _with the young Nobility of Rome_.[3414]

    _Cor._ Come, leave your tears; a brief farewell: the beast
    With many heads butts me away. Nay, mother,
    Where is your ancient courage? you were used
    To say extremity was the trier of spirits;[3415]
    That common chances common men could bear;[3416]                   5
    That when the sea was calm all boats alike
    Show'd mastership in floating; fortune's blows,[3417]
    When most struck home, being gentle wounded, craves[3417][3418][3419]
    A noble cunning: you were used to load me[3419][3420]
    With precepts that would make invincible                          10
    The heart that conn'd them.

    _Vir._ O heavens! O heavens!

    _Cor._                       Nay, I prithee, woman,--[3421]

    _Vol._ Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome,
    And occupations perish!

    _Cor._                  What, what, what!
    I shall be loved when I am lack'd. Nay, mother,                   15
    Resume that spirit, when you were wont to say,
    If you had been the wife of Hercules,
    Six of his labours you'ld have done, and saved
    Your husband so much sweat. Cominius,
    Droop not; adieu. Farewell, my wife, my mother:                   20
    I'll do well yet. Thou old and true Menenius,
    Thy tears are salter than a younger man's,
    And venomous to thine eyes. My sometime general,
    I have seen thee stern, and thou hast oft beheld[3422]
    Heart-hardening spectacles; tell these sad women,                 25
    'Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes,
    As 'tis to laugh at 'em. My mother, you wot well[3423]
    My hazards still have been your solace: and
    Believe 't not lightly--though I go alone,
    Like to a lonely dragon, that his fen[3424]                       30
    Makes fear'd and talk'd of more than seen--your son
    Will or exceed the common, or be caught[3425]
    With cautelous baits and practice.

    _Vol._                             My first son,[3426]
    Whither wilt thou go? Take good Cominius[3427]
    With thee awhile: determine on some course,[3428]                 35
    More than a wild exposture to each chance[3429]
    That starts i' the way before thee.

    _Cor._                              O the gods![3430]

    _Com._ I'll follow thee a month, devise with thee
    Where thou shalt rest, that thou mayst hear of us
    And we of thee: so, if the time thrust forth                      40
    A cause for thy repeal, we shall not send
    O'er the vast world to seek a single man,
    And lose advantage, which doth ever cool
    I' the absence of the needer.[3431]

    _Cor._                        Fare ye well:
    Thou hast years upon thee; and thou art too full[3432]            45
    Of the wars' surfeits, to go rove with one[3433]
    That's yet unbruised: bring me but out at gate.
    Come, my sweet wife, my dearest mother, and
    My friends of noble touch, when I am forth,
    Bid me farewell, and smile. I pray you, come.                     50
    While I remain above the ground, you shall
    Hear from me still, and never of me aught
    But what is like me formerly.

    _Men._                        That's worthily
    As any ear can hear. Come, let's not weep.
    If I could shake off but one seven years                          55
    From these old arms and legs, by the good gods,
    I'ld with thee every foot.

    _Cor._                     Give me thy hand:
    Come.                                               [_Exeunt._[3434]

    The nobility are vex'd, whom we see have sided[3436]
    In his behalf.

    _Bru._         Now we have shown our power,
    Let us seem humbler after it is done
    Than when it was a-doing.

    _Sic._                    Bid them home:                           5

    Stand in their ancient strength.

    _Bru._                Dismiss them home.  [_Exit Ædile._[3437][3438]

    _Bru._                                     Why?

    _Sic._ They say she's mad.[3440]

    _Bru._ They have ta'en note of us: keep on your way.[3440]        10

    _Vol._ O, ye're well met: the hoarded plague o' the gods[3441][3442]
    Requite your love![3442][3443]

    _Men._             Peace, peace; be not so loud.

    _Vol._ If that I could for weeping, you should hear,--
    Nay, and you shall hear some. [_To Brutus_] Will you be gone?[3444]

    _Vir._ [_To Sicinius_] You shall stay too: I would I had
              the power[3445][3446]  15
    To say so to my husband.[3446][3447]

    _Sic._                   Are you mankind?

    _Vol._ Ay, fool; is that a shame? Note but this fool.
    Was not a man my father? Hadst thou foxship
    To banish him that struck more blows for Rome[3448]
    Than thou hast spoken words?[3449]

    _Sic._                       O blessed heavens!                   20

    _Vol._ Moe noble blows than ever thou wise words;[3450]
    And for Rome's good. I'll tell thee what; yet go:[3451]
    Nay, but thou shalt stay too: I would my son
    Were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him,
    His good sword in his hand.

    _Sic._                      What then?

    _Vir._                                 What then![3452][3453]     25
    He'ld make an end of thy posterity.[3452][3453]

    _Vol._ Bastards and all.[3452]
    Good man, the wounds that he does bear for Rome![3452]

    _Men._ Come, come, peace.

    _Sic._ I would he had continued to his country                    30
    As he began, and not unknit himself
    The noble knot he made.[3454]

    _Bru._                  I would he had.

    _Vol._ 'I would he had!' 'Twas you incensed the rabble;
    Cats, that can judge as fitly of his worth[3455]
    As I can of those mysteries which heaven                          35
    Will not have earth to know.

    _Bru._                       Pray, let us go.[3456]

    _Vol._ Now, pray, sir, get you gone:
    You have done a brave deed. Ere you go, hear this:[3457]
    As far as doth the Capitol exceed
    The meanest house in Rome, so far my son--                        40
    This lady's husband here, this, do you see?--
    Whom you have banish'd, does exceed you all.

    _Bru._ Well, well, we'll leave you.

    _Sic._                              Why stay we to be baited[3458]
    With one that wants her wits?

    _Vol._                        Take my prayers with you.

                                               [_Exeunt Tribunes._[3459]

    I would the gods had nothing else to do[3460]                     45
    But to confirm my curses! Could I meet 'em[3461]
    But once a-day, it would unclog my heart
    Of what lies heavy to 't.

    _Men._                    You have told them home;[3462][3463]
    And, by my troth, you have cause. You'll sup with me?[3462][3464]

    _Vol._ Anger's my meat; I sup upon myself,                        50
    And so shall starve with feeding. Come, let's go:[3465]
    Leave this faint puling, and lament as I do,[3466]
    In anger, Juno-like. Come, come, come.[3467]

                                           [_Exeunt Vol. and Vir._[3468]

    find you out there: you have well saved me a day's journey.[3475]

    _Rom._ There hath been in Rome strange insurrections;[3476]
    the people against the senators, patricians and nobles.

    _Vols._ Hath been! is it ended then? Our state thinks[3477]
    not so: they are in a most warlike preparation, and hope          15
    to come upon them in the heat of their division.

    _Rom._ The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing
    would make it flame again: for the nobles receive so to
    heart the banishment of that worthy Coriolanus, that they
    are in a ripe aptness to take all power from the people and       20
    to pluck from them their tribunes for ever. This lies glowing,
    I can tell you, and is almost mature for the violent
    breaking out.

    _Vols._ Coriolanus banished!

    _Rom._ Banished, sir.                                             25

    _Vols._ You will be welcome with this intelligence,
    Nicanor.

    _Rom._ The day serves well for them now. I have heard
    it said, the fittest time to corrupt a man's wife is when she's
    fallen out with her husband. Your noble Tullus Aufidius           30
    will appear well in these wars, his great opposer, Coriolanus,[3478]
    being now in no request of his country.

    _Vols._ He cannot choose. I am most fortunate, thus
    accidentally to encounter you: you have ended my business,
    and I will merrily accompany you home.                            35

    _Rom._ I shall, between this and supper, tell you most
    strange things from Rome; all tending to the good of their
    adversaries. Have you an army ready, say you?

    _Vols._ A most royal one; the centurions and their
    charges, distinctly billeted, already in the entertainment,       40
    and to be on foot at an hour's warning.

    _Rom._ I am joyful to hear of their readiness, and am
    the man, I think, that shall set them in present action. So,
    sir, heartily well met, and most glad of your company.

    _Vols._ You take my part from me, sir; I have the most[3479]      45
    cause to be glad of yours.

    _Rom._ Well, let us go together.                          [_Exeunt._


SCENE IV. _Antium. Before Aufidius's house._[3480]

      _Enter_ CORIOLANUS _in mean apparel, disguised and muffled_.

    _Cor._ A goodly city is this Antium. City,
    'Tis I that made thy widows: many an heir
    Of these fair edifices 'fore my wars[3481]
    Have I heard groan and drop: then know me not;
    Lest that thy wives with spits, and boys with stones,[3482]        5
    In puny battle slay me.

                        _Enter a_ Citizen.[3483]

                            Save you, sir.

    _Cit._ And you.

    _Cor._           Direct me, if it be your will,[3484]
    Where great Aufidius lies: is he in Antium?[3484]

    _Cit._ He is, and feasts the nobles of the state[3484]
    At his house this night.[3484]

    _Cor._                   Which is his house, beseech you?[3485]   10

    _Cit._ This, here, before you.

    _Cor._                          Thank you, sir: farewell.

                                                        [_Exit Citizen._

    O world, thy slippery turns! Friends now fast sworn,
    Whose double bosoms seem to wear one heart,[3486]
    Whose hours, whose bed, whose meal and exercise[3487]
    Are still together, who twin, as 'twere, in love[3488]            15
    Unseparable, shall within this hour,
    On a dissension of a doit, break out
    To bitterest enmity: so, fellest foes,
    Whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep
    To take the one the other, by some chance,                        20
    Some trick not worth an egg, shall grow dear friends
    And interjoin their issues. So with me:
    My birth-place hate I, and my love's upon[3489]
    This enemy town. I'll enter: if he slay me,[3490]
    He does fair justice; if he give me way,                          25
    I'll do his country service.                                [_Exit._


SCENE V. _The same. A hall in Aufidius's house._[3491]

                  _Music within. Enter a_ Servingman.

    _First Serv._ Wine, wine, wine!--What service is here!
    I think our fellows are asleep.                       [_Exit._[3492]

                      _Enter another_ Servingman.

    _Sec. Serv._ Where's Cotus? my master calls for him.[3493]
    Cotus!                                                      [_Exit._

                          _Enter_ CORIOLANUS.

    _Cor._ A goodly house: the feast smells well; but I[3494][3495]    5
    Appear not like a guest.[3494][3496]

                 _Re-enter the first_ Servingman.[3497]

    _First Serv._ What would you have, friend? whence are
    you? Here's no place for you: pray, go to the door.   [_Exit._[3498]

    _Cor._ I have deserved no better entertainment,[3499]
    In being Coriolanus.[3499]                                        10

                  _Re-enter second_ Servingman.[3500]

    _Sec. Serv._ Whence are you, sir? Has the porter his
    eyes in his head, that he gives entrance to such companions?
    Pray, get you out.

    _Cor._ Away!

    _Sec. Serv._ 'Away!' get you away.                                15

    _Cor._ Now thou'rt troublesome.[3501]

    _Sec. Serv._ Are you so brave? I'll have you talked
    with anon.[3502]

        _Enter a third_ Servingman. _The first meets him._[3503]

    _Third Serv._ What fellow's this?

    _First Serv._ A strange one as ever I looked on: I cannot[3504] 20
    get him out o' the house: prithee, call my master to him.

                                                       [_Retires._[3505]

    _Third Serv._ What have you to do here, fellow? Pray
    you, avoid the house.

    _Cor._ Let me but stand; I will not hurt your hearth.

    _Third Serv._ What are you?                                       25

    _Cor._ A gentleman.

    _Third Serv._ A marvellous poor one.

    _Cor._ True, so I am.

    _Third Serv._ Pray you, poor gentleman, take up some
    other station; here's no place for you; pray you, avoid:          30
    come.[3506]

    _Cor._ Follow your function, go, and batten on cold bits.[3507]

                                            [_Pushes him away from him._

    _Third Serv._ What, you will not? Prithee, tell my[3508]
    master what a strange guest he has here.

    _Sec. Serv._ And I shall.                         [_Exit._[3509]  35

    _Third Serv._ Where dwell'st thou?[3510]

    _Cor._ Under the canopy.

    _Third Serv._ Under the canopy!

    _Cor._ Ay.

    _Third Serv._ Where's that?                                       40

    _Cor._ I' the city of kites and crows.

    _Third Serv._ I' the city of kites and crows! What an[3511]
    ass it is! Then thou dwell'st with daws too?[3510]

    _Cor._ No, I serve not thy master.

    _Third Serv._ How, sir! do you meddle with my master?             45

    _Cor._ Ay; 'tis an honester service than to meddle with[3512]
    thy mistress:[3512]
    Thou pratest, and pratest; serve with thy trencher, hence!
    [_Beats him away. Exit third Servingman._

          _Enter_ AUFIDIUS _with the second_ Servingman.[3513]

    _Auf._ Where is this fellow?

    _Sec. Serv._ Here, sir: I'ld have beaten him like a dog,          50
    but for disturbing the lords within.               [_Retires._[3514]

    _Auf._ Whence comest thou? what wouldst thou? thy name?[3515]
    Why speak'st not? speak, man: what's thy name?[3516]

    _Cor._ [_Unmuffling_]                       If, Tullus,[3517][3518]
    Not yet thou knowest me, and, seeing me, dost not[3518]
    Think me for the man I am, necessity[3518][3519]                  55
    Commands me name myself.[3518][3520]

    _Auf._                   What is thy name?

    _Cor._ A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears,[3521]
    And harsh in sound to thine.

    _Auf._                       Say, what's thy name?
    Thou hast a grim appearance, and thy face
    Bears a command in 't; though thy tackle's torn,[3522]            60
    Thou show'st a noble vessel: what's thy name?

    _Cor._ Prepare thy brow to frown:--know'st thou me yet?

    _Auf._ I know thee not:--thy name?[3523]

    _Cor._ My name is Caius Marcius, who hath done[3524]
    To thee particularly, and to all the Volsces,                     65
    Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness may
    My surname, Coriolanus: the painful service,
    The extreme dangers, and the drops of blood
    Shed for my thankless country, are requited[3525]
    But with that surname; a good memory,[3526]                       70
    And witness of the malice and displeasure
    Which thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains:[3527]
    The cruelty and envy of the people,[3528]
    Permitted by our dastard nobles, who
    Have all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest;                      75
    And suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to be
    Whoop'd out of Rome. Now, this extremity[3529]
    Hath brought me to thy hearth: not out of hope--
    Mistake me not--to save my life, for if
    I had fear'd death, of all the men i' the world                   80
    I would have 'voided thee; but in mere spite,[3530]
    To be full quit of those my banishers,
    Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast
    A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge[3531]
    Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims[3532]            85
    Of shame seen through thy country, speed thee straight,[3532]
    And make my misery serve thy turn: so use it
    That my revengeful services may prove
    As benefits to thee; for I will fight
    Against my canker'd country with the spleen                       90
    Of all the under fiends. But if so be
    Thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes
    Thou'rt tired, then, in a word, I also am[3533]
    Longer to live most weary, and present
    My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;                      95
    Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,[3534]
    Since I have ever follow'd thee with hate,
    Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast,
    And cannot live but to thy shame, unless
    It be to do thee service.

    _Auf._                    O Marcius, Marcius![3535]              100
    Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart[3536]
    A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter[3537]
    Should from yond cloud speak divine things,[3538]
    And say 'Tis true,' I'ld not believe them more[3539]
    Than thee, all noble Marcius. Let me twine[3540]                 105
    Mine arms about that body, where against[3541]
    My grained ash an hundred times hath broke,
    And scarr'd the moon with splinters: here I clip[3542]
    The anvil of my sword, and do contest
    As hotly and as nobly with thy love                              110
    As ever in ambitious strength I did
    Contend against thy valour. Know thou first,[3543]
    I loved the maid I married; never man[3543]
    Sigh'd truer breath; but that I see thee here,
    Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart                      115
    Than when I first my wedded mistress saw
    Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars! I tell thee,[3544]
    We have a power on foot; and I had purpose
    Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
    Or lose mine arm for't: thou hast beat me out[3545]              120
    Twelve several times, and I have nightly since
    Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me;
    We have been down together in my sleep,
    Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat;
    And waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,                125
    Had we no quarrel else to Rome but that[3546]
    Thou art thence banish'd, we would muster all
    From twelve to seventy, and pouring war
    Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,
    Like a bold flood o'er-beat. O, come, go in,[3547]               130
    And take our friendly senators by the hands,
    Who now are here, taking their leaves of me,
    Who am prepared against your territories,
    Though not for Rome itself.

    _Cor._                      You bless me, gods!

    _Auf._ Therefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt have           135
    The leading of thine own revenges, take
    The one half of my commission, and set down--[3548]
    As best thou art experienced, since thou know'st
    Thy country's strength and weakness--thine own ways;
    Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,                      140
    Or rudely visit them in parts remote,
    To fright them, ere destroy. But come in:[3549]
    Let me commend thee first to those that shall[3550]
    Say yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!
    And more a friend than e'er an enemy;                            145
    Yet, Marcius, that was much. Your hand: most welcome!

                    [_Exeunt Coriolanus and Aufidius. The two Servingmen
                                                    come forward._[3551]


    _First Serv._ Here's a strange alteration![3552]

    _Sec. Serv._ By my hand, I had thought to have strucken[3553]
    him with a cudgel; and yet my mind gave me his clothes[3554]
    made a false report of him.                                      150

    _First Serv._ What an arm he has! he turned me about
    with his finger and his thumb, as one would set up a top.

    _Sec. Serv._ Nay, I knew by his face that there was
    something in him: he had, sir, a kind of face, methought,--I[3555]
    cannot tell how to term it.                                      155

    _First Serv._ He had so; looking as it were--Would I[3556]
    were hanged, but I thought there was more in him than I
    could think.

    _Sec. Serv._ So did I, I'll be sworn: he is simply the
    rarest man i' the world.                                         160

    _First Serv._ I think he is: but a greater soldier than
    he, you wot one.[3557]

    _Sec. Serv._ Who? my master?[3558]

    _First Serv._ Nay, it's no matter for that.

    _Sec. Serv._ Worth six on him.                                   165

    _First Serv._ Nay, not so neither: but I take him to be
    the greater soldier.

    _Sec. Serv._ Faith, look you, one cannot tell how to say
    that: for the defence of a town, our general is excellent.

    _First Serv._ Ay, and for an assault too.                        170

                   _Re-enter third_ Servingman.[3559]

    _Third Serv._ O slaves, I can tell you news; news, you[3560]
    rascals!

    _First and Sec. Serv._ What, what, what? let's partake.[3561]

    _Third Serv._ I would not be a Roman, of all nations;
    I had as lieve be a condemned man.[3562]                         175

    _First and Sec. Serv._ Wherefore? wherefore?[3561]

    _Third Serv._ Why, here's he that was wont to thwack
    our general, Caius Marcius.

    _First Serv._ Why do you say, thwack our general?

    _Third Serv._ I do not say, thwack our general; but he           180
    was always good enough for him.

    _Sec. Serv._ Come, we are fellows and friends: he was
    ever too hard for him; I have heard him say so himself.

    _First Serv._ He was too hard for him directly, to say
    the troth on 't: before Corioli he scotched him and notched[3563]  185
    him like a carbonado.[3564]

    _Sec. Serv._ An he had been cannibally given, he might[3565]
    have broiled and eaten him too.[3566]

    _First Serv._ But, more of thy news?[3567]

    _Third Serv._ Why, he is so made on here within as if            190
    he were son and heir to Mars; set at upper end o' the
    table; no question asked him by any of the senators, but
    they stand bald before him. Our general himself makes a
    mistress of him; sanctifies himself with 's hand, and turns[3568]
    up the white o' the eye to his discourse. But the bottom of      195
    the news is, our general is cut i' the middle, and but one
    half of what he was yesterday; for the other has half, by
    the entreaty and grant of the whole table. He'll go, he
    says, and sowl the porter of Rome gates by the ears: he will[3569]
    mow all down before him, and leave his passage poll'd.[3570]     200

    _Sec. Serv._ And he's as like to do't as any man I can
    imagine.

    _Third Serv._ Do't! he will do't; for, look you, sir, he
    has as many friends as enemies; which friends, sir, as it
    were, durst not, look you, sir, show themselves, as we term      205
    it, his friends whilst he's in directitude.[3571][3572]

    _First Serv._ Directitude! what's that?[3572]

    _Third Serv._ But when they shall see, sir, his crest up
    again and the man in blood, they will out of their burrows,
    like conies after rain, and revel all with him.[3573]            210

    _First Serv._ But when goes this forward?

    _Third Serv._ To-morrow; to-day; presently: you shall
    have the drum struck up this afternoon: 'tis, as it were, a
    parcel of their feast, and to be executed ere they wipe their
    lips.                                                            215

    _Sec. Serv._ Why, then we shall have a stirring world
    again. This peace is nothing, but to rust iron, increase[3574]
    tailors and breed ballad-makers.

    _First Serv._ Let me have war, say I; it exceeds peace
    as far as day does night; it's spritely, waking, audible, and[3575]  220
    full of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy, mull'd,[3576]
    deaf, sleepy, insensible; a getter of more bastard children[3577]
    than war's a destroyer of men.[3578]

    _Sec. Serv._ 'Tis so: and as war, in some sort, may be[3579]
    said to be a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a     225
    great maker of cuckolds.

    _First Serv._ Ay, and it makes men hate one another.

    _Third Serv._ Reason; because they then less need one
    another. The wars for my money. I hope to see Romans
    as cheap as Volscians. They are rising, they are rising.         230

    _First and Sec. Serv._ In, in, in, in!              [_Exeunt._[3580]


SCENE VI. _Rome. A public place._[3581]

            _Enter the two Tribunes_, SICINIUS _and_ BRUTUS.

    _Sic._ We hear not of him, neither need we fear him;
    His remedies are tame i' the present peace[3582]
    And quietness of the people, which before
    Were in wild hurry. Here do we make his friends[3583]
    Blush that the world goes well; who rather had,                    5
    Though they themselves did suffer by't, behold[3584]
    Dissentious numbers pestering streets than see
    Our tradesmen singing in their shops and going
    About their functions friendly.

    _Bru._ We stood to 't in good time.

                           _Enter_ MENENIUS.

                                        Is this Menenius?[3585]       10

    _Sic._ 'Tis he, 'tis he: O, he is grown most kind[3586]
    Of late. Hail, sir![3586][3587]

    _Men._              Hail to you both!

    _Sic._ Your Coriolanus is not much miss'd,[3588]
    But with his friends: the commonwealth doth stand;[3588]
    And so would do, were he more angry at it.[3588]                  15

    _Men._ All's well; and might have been much better, if[3588]
    He could have temporized.[3588]

    _Sic._                        Where is he, hear you?

    _Men._ Nay, I hear nothing: his mother and his wife[3589]
    Hear nothing from him.[3589]

                    _Enter three or four_ Citizens.

    _Citizens._ The gods preserve you both![3590]

    _Sic._                      God-den, our neighbours.[3591][3592]  20

    _Bru._ God-den to you all, god-den to you all.[3591]

    _First Cit._ Ourselves, our wives, and children, on our knees,
    Are bound to pray for you both.

    _Sic._ Live, and thrive![3593]

    _Bru._ Farewell, kind neighbours: we wish'd Coriolanus[3594]
    Had loved you as we did.[3594]

    _Citizens._              Now the gods keep you![3590]             25

    _Both Tri._ Farewell, farewell.                  [_Exeunt Citizens._

    _Sic._ This is a happier and more comely time
    Than when these fellows ran about the streets,
    Crying confusion.

    _Bru._            Caius Marcius was
    A worthy officer i' the war, but insolent,                        30
    O'ercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking,[3595]
    Self-loving,--[3596]

    _Sic._         And affecting one sole throne,[3597][3598]
    Without assistance.[3597]

    _Men._              I think not so.[3599]

    _Sic._ We should by this, to all our lamentation,[3600]
    If he had gone forth consul, found it so.[3601]                   35

    _Bru._ The gods have well prevented it, and Rome
    Sits safe and still without him.

                           _Enter an_ Ædile.

    _Æd._                            Worthy tribunes,
    There is a slave, whom we have put in prison,
    Reports, the Volsces with two several powers
    Are enter'd in the Roman territories,                             40
    And with the deepest malice of the war
    Destroy what lies before 'em.[3602]

    _Men._                        'Tis Aufidius,
    Who, hearing of our Marcius' banishment,
    Thrusts forth his horns again into the world;
    Which were inshell'd when Marcius stood for Rome,                 45
    And durst not once peep out.

    _Sic._                       Come, what talk you[3603]
    Of Marcius?[3603]

    _Bru._ Go see this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot be[3604]
    The Volsces dare break with us.

    _Men._                          Cannot be!
    We have record that very well it can,                             50
    And three examples of the like have been[3605]
    Within my age. But reason with the fellow,
    Before you punish him, where he heard this,
    Lest you shall chance to whip your information
    And beat the messenger who bids beware                            55
    Of what is to be dreaded.

    _Sic._                    Tell not me:[3606]
    I know this cannot be.[3606]

    _Bru._                 Not possible.

                          _Enter a_ Messenger.

    _Mess._ The nobles in great earnestness are going
    All to the senate-house: some news is come[3607]
    That turns their countenances.

    _Sic._                         'Tis this slave;                   60
    Go whip him 'fore the people's eyes: his raising;
    Nothing but his report.

    _Mess._                 Yes, worthy sir,
    The slave's report is seconded; and more,
    More fearful, is deliver'd.[3608]

    _Sic._                      What more fearful?

    _Mess._ It is spoke freely out of many mouths--                   65
    How probable I do not know--that Marcius,
    Join'd with Aufidius, leads a power 'gainst Rome,
    And vows revenge as spacious as between
    The young'st and oldest thing.[3609]

    _Sic._                         This is most likely![3610]

    _Bru._ Raised only, that the weaker sort may wish[3610]           70
    Good Marcius home again.[3610][3611]

    _Sic._                   The very trick on't.

    _Men._ This is unlikely:
    He and Aufidius can no more atone[3612]
    Than violentest contrariety.

                   _Enter a second_ Messenger.[3613]

    _Sec. Mess._ You are sent for to the senate:[3614]                75
    A fearful army, led by Caius Marcius
    Associated with Aufidius, rages
    Upon our territories; and have already[3615]
    O'erborne their way, consumed with fire, and took
    What lay before them.                                             80

                           _Enter_ COMINIUS.

    _Com._ O, you have made good work!

    _Men._                             What news? what news?

    _Com._ You have holp to ravish your own daughters, and
    To melt the city leads upon your pates;
    To see your wives dishonour'd to your noses,--[3616]

    _Men._ What's the news? what's the news?                          85

    _Com._ Your temples burned in their cement, and[3617]
    Your franchises, whereon you stood, confined
    Into an auger's bore.[3618]

    _Men._                Pray now, your news?--
    You have made fair work, I fear me.--Pray, your news?--
    If Marcius should be join'd with Volscians,--[3619]

    _Com._                                        If![3620]           90
    He is their god: he leads them like a thing[3620]
    Made by some other deity than nature,
    That shapes man better; and they follow him,
    Against us brats, with no less confidence
    Than boys pursuing summer butterflies,                            95
    Or butchers killing flies.

    _Men._                     You have made good work,[3621]
    You and your apron-men; you that stood so much[3622]
    Upon the voice of occupation and
    The breath of garlic-eaters!

    _Com._ He'll shake your Rome about your ears.[3623]

    _Men._                                        As Hercules[3624]  100
    Did shake down mellow fruit. You have made fair work![3624]

    _Bru._ But is this true, sir?

    _Com._                        Ay; and you'll look pale
    Before you find it other. All the regions[3625]
    Do smilingly revolt; and who resist[3626]
    Are mock'd for valiant ignorance,[3627]                          105
    And perish constant fools. Who is't can blame him?[3628]
    Your enemies and his find something in him.[3628]

    _Men._ We are all undone, unless[3628][3629]
    The noble man have mercy.

    _Com._                    Who shall ask it?
    The tribunes cannot do't for shame; the people                   110
    Deserve such pity of him as the wolf
    Does of the shepherds: for his best friends, if they[3630]
    Should say 'Be good to Rome,' they charged him even[3631]
    As those should do that had deserved his hate,[3631]
    And therein show'd like enemies.[3631]

    _Men._                           'Tis true:[3632]                115
    If he were putting to my house the brand[3632]
    That should consume it, I have not the face[3633]
    To say 'Beseech you, cease.' You have made fair hands,[3634]
    You and your crafts! you have crafted fair![3635][3634]

    _Com._                                      You have brought
    A trembling upon Rome, such as was never                         120
    So incapable of help.

    _Both Tri._           Say not, we brought it.[3636]

    _Men._ How! was it we? we loved him; but, like beasts[3637][3638]
    And cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters,[3637][3639]
    Who did hoot him out o' the city.[3637][3640]

    _Com._                            But I fear
    They'll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius,                      125
    The second name of men, obeys his points
    As if he were his officer: desperation
    Is all the policy, strength and defence,
    That Rome can make against them.

                      _Enter a troop of_ Citizens.

    _Men._                           Here come the clusters[3641]
    And is Aufidius with him? You are they                           130
    That made the air unwholesome, when you cast[3642]
    Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at[3643]
    Coriolanus' exile. Now he's coming;[3643][3644]
    And not a hair upon a soldier's head
    Which will not prove a whip: as many coxcombs                    135
    As you threw caps up will he tumble down,
    And pay you for your voices. 'Tis no matter;
    If he could burn us all into one coal,[3645]
    We have deserved it.

    _Citizens._ Faith, we hear fearful news.[3646]

    _First Cit._                             For mine own part,      140
    When I said, banish him, I said, 'twas pity.

    _Sec. Cit._ And so did I.

    _Third Cit._ And so did I; and, to say the truth, so did[3647]
    very many of us: that we did, we did for the best; and
    though we willingly consented to his banishment, yet it was      145
    against our will.

    _Com._ Ye're goodly things, you voices![3648]

    _Men._                                    You have made[3649][3650]
    Good work, you and your cry! Shall 's to the Capitol?[3649]

    _Com._ O, ay, what else?      [_Exeunt Cominius and Menenius._[3651]

    _Sic._ Go, masters, get you home; be not dismay'd:               150
    These are a side that would be glad to have
    This true which they so seem to fear. Go home,
    And show no sign of fear.

    _First Cit._ The gods be good to us! Come, masters,
    let's home. I ever said we were i' the wrong when we             155
    banished him.

    _Sec. Cit._ So did we all. But, come, let's home.

                                              [_Exeunt Citizens._[3652]

    _Bru._ I do not like this news.

    _Sic._ Nor I.

    _Bru._ Let's to the Capitol: would half my wealth                160
    Would buy this for a lie!

    _Sic._                    Pray, let us go.          [_Exeunt._[3653]


SCENE VII. _A camp, at a small distance from Rome._

             _Enter_ AUFIDIUS _with his_ Lieutenant.[3654]

    _Auf._ Do they still fly to the Roman?

    _Lieu._ I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but[3655]
    Your soldiers use him as the grace 'fore meat,
    Their talk at table and their thanks at end;
    And you are darken'd in this action, sir,                          5
    Even by your own.

    _Auf._            I cannot help it now,[3656]
    Unless, by using means, I lame the foot[3656]
    Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier,[3657]
    Even to my person, than I thought he would
    When first I did embrace him: yet his nature                      10
    In that's no changeling; and I must excuse
    What cannot be amended.

    _Lieu._                 Yet I wish, sir--
    I mean for your particular--you had not
    Join'd in commission with him; but either[3658][3659]
    Had borne the action of yourself, or else[3658][3659]             15
    To him had left it solely.[3658]

    _Auf._ I understand thee well; and be thou sure,
    When he shall come to his account, he knows not
    What I can urge against him. Although it seems,[3660]
    And so he thinks, and is no less apparent                         20
    To the vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly,
    And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,
    Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon
    As draw his sword, yet he hath left undone
    That which shall break his neck or hazard mine,                   25
    Whene'er we come to our account.[3661]

    _Lieu._ Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?[3661][3662]

    _Auf._ All places yield to him ere he sits down;[3663]
    And the nobility of Rome are his:
    The senators and patricians love him too:[3664]                   30
    The tribunes are no soldiers; and their people
    Will be as rash in the repeal, as hasty
    To expel him thence. I think he'll be to Rome
    As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it[3665]
    By sovereignty of nature. First he was                            35
    A noble servant to them; but he could not
    Carry his honours even: whether 'twas pride,[3666]
    Which out of daily fortune ever taints
    The happy man; whether defect of judgement,[3667]
    To fail in the disposing of those chances                         40
    Which he was lord of; or whether nature,[3668][3669]
    Not to be other than one thing, not moving[3669]
    From the casque to the cushion, but commanding peace[3670]
    Even with the same austerity and garb
    As he controll'd the war; but one of these--                      45
    As he hath spices of them all, not all,[3671][3672]
    For I dare so far free him--made him fear'd,[3671]
    So hated, and so banish'd: but he has a merit,[3673]
    To choke it in the utterance. So our virtues[3674]
    Lie in the interpretation of the time;[3675]                      50
    And power, unto itself most commendable,
    Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair[3676]
    To extol what it hath done.
    One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;
    Rights by rights fouler, strengths by strengths do fail.[3677]    55
    Come, let's away. When, Caius, Rome is thine,
    Thou art poor'st of all; then shortly art thou mine. [_Exeunt._[3678]

ACT V.


SCENE I. _Rome. A public place._

      _Enter_ MENENIUS, COMINIUS, SICINIUS _and_ BRUTUS, _the two_
                     Tribunes, _and others_.[3679]

    _Men._ No, I'll not go: you hear what he hath said
    Which was sometime his general, who loved him[3680]
    In a most dear particular. He call'd me father:
    But what o' that? Go, you that banish'd him;[3681]
    A mile before his tent fall down, and knee[3681][3682]             5
    The way into his mercy: nay, if he coy'd
    To hear Cominius speak, I'll keep at home.

    _Com._ He would not seem to know me.

    _Men._                               Do you hear?

    _Com._ Yet one time he did call me by my name:
    I urged our old acquaintance, and the drops                       10
    That we have bled together. Coriolanus
    He would not answer to: forbad all names;
    He was a kind of nothing, titleless,
    Till he had forged himself a name o' the fire[3683]
    Of burning Rome.

    _Men._           Why, so: you have made good work![3684]          15
    A pair of tribunes that have rack'd for Rome,[3685]
    To make coals cheap: a noble memory![3686]

    _Com._ I minded him how royal 'twas to pardon
    When it was less expected: he replied,[3687]
    It was a bare petition of a state[3688]                           20
    To one whom they had punish'd.

    _Men._                         Very well:[3689]
    Could he say less?[3689]

    _Com._ I offer'd to awaken his regard
    For 's private friends: his answer to me was,[3690]
    He could not stay to pick them in a pile                          25
    Of noisome musty chaff, he said 'twas folly,
    For one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt,
    And still to nose the offence.

    _Men._                         For one poor grain or two!
    I am one of those; his mother, wife, his child,[3691]
    And this brave fellow too, we are the grains:[3692]               30
    You are the musty chaff, and you are smelt
    Above the moon: we must be burnt for you.

    _Sic._ Nay, pray, be patient: if you refuse your aid
    In this so never-needed help, yet do not[3693]
    Upbraid's with our distress. But, sure, if you[3694]              35
    Would be your country's pleader, your good tongue,
    More than the instant army we can make,
    Might stop our countryman.

    _Men._                     No, I'll not meddle.

    _Sic._ Pray you, go to him.

    _Men._                      What should I do?[3695]

    _Bru._ Only make trial what your love can do                      40
    For Rome, towards Marcius.

    _Men._                     Well, and say that Marcius[3696]
    Return me, as Cominius is return'd,[3697][3696]
    Unheard; what then?[3696][3698][3699]
    But as a discontented friend, grief-shot[3699][3700]
    With his unkindness? say 't be so?[3701]

    _Sic._                            Yet your good will              45
    Must have that thanks from Rome, after the measure[3702]
    As you intended well.

    _Men._                I'll undertake 't:[3703]
    I think he'll hear me. Yet, to bite his lip
    And hum at good Cominius, much unhearts me.
    He was not taken well; he had not dined:                          50
    The veins unfill'd, our blood is cold, and then
    We pout upon the morning, are unapt
    To give or to forgive; but when we have stuff'd[3704]
    These pipes and these conveyances of our blood[3705]
    With wine and feeding, we have suppler souls                      55
    Than in our priest-like fasts: therefore I'll watch him
    Till he be dieted to my request,
    And then I'll set upon him.

    _Bru._ You know the very road into his kindness,
    And cannot lose your way.

    _Men._                   Good faith, I'll prove him,[3706]        60
    Speed how it will. I shall ere long have knowledge[3706]
    Of my success.                                              [_Exit._

    _Com._         He'll never hear him.

    _Sec._                               Not?[3707]

    _Com._ I tell you, he does sit in gold, his eye[3708]
    Red as 'twould burn Rome; and his injury
    The gaoler to his pity. I kneel'd before him;                     65
    'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise;' dismiss'd me
    Thus, with his speechless hand: what he would do,
    He sent in writing after me; what he would not,[3709][3710]
    Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions:[3710][3711][3712]
    So that all hope is vain,[3710][3711][3713]                       70
    Unless his noble mother, and his wife;[3713][3714]
    Who, as I hear, mean to solicit him[3713][3715]
    For mercy to his country. Therefore, let's hence,[3716]
    And with our fair entreaties haste them on.               [_Exeunt._


SCENE II. _Entrance of the Volscian camp before Rome. Two Sentinels on
guard._

                    _Enter to them_, MENENIUS.[3717]

    _First Sen._ Stay: whence are you?[3718]

    _Sec. Sen._                        Stand, and go back.[3719]

    _Men._ You guard like men; 'tis well: but, by your leave,
    I am an officer of state, and come[3720]
    To speak with Coriolanus.[3720]

    _First Sen._              From whence?[3721]

    _Men._                                 From Rome.

    _First Sen._ You may not pass, you must return: our general[3722]  5
    Will no more hear from thence.[3722][3723]

    _Sec. Sen._ You'll see your Rome embraced with fire, before
    You'll speak with Coriolanus.

    _Men._                        Good my friends,
    If you have heard your general talk of Rome
    And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks[3724]              10
    My name hath touch'd your ears: it is Menenius.

    _First Sen._ Be it so; go back: the virtue of your name
    Is not here passable.

    _Men._                I tell thee, fellow,[3725]
    Thy general is my lover: I have been
    The book of his good acts, whence men have read                   15
    His fame unparallel'd haply amplified;[3726]
    For I have ever verified my friends,[3727]
    Of whom he's chief, with all the size that verity[3728]
    Would without lapsing suffer: nay, sometimes,
    Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,                              20
    I have tumbled past the throw, and in his praise[3729]
    Have almost stamp'd the leasing: therefore, fellow,
    I must have leave to pass.

    _First Sen._ Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in
    his behalf as you have uttered words in your own, you             25
    should not pass here; no, though it were as virtuous to lie
    as to live chastely. Therefore go back.

    _Men._ Prithee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius,
    always factionary on the party of your general.[3730]

    _Sec. Sen._ Howsoever you have been his liar, as you say          30
    you have, I am one that, telling true under him, must say,
    you cannot pass. Therefore go back.

    _Men._ Has he dined, canst thou tell? for I would not
    speak with him till after dinner.

    _First Sen._ You are a Roman, are you?                            35

    _Men._ I am, as thy general is.[3731]

    _First Sen._ Then you should hate Rome, as he does. Can
    you, when you have pushed out your gates the very defender[3732]
    of them, and, in a violent popular ignorance, given your
    enemy your shield, think to front his revenges with the easy[3733]  40
    groans of old women, the virginal palms of your daughters,[3734]
    or with the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as[3735]
    you seem to be? Can you think to blow out the intended
    fire your city is ready to flame in, with such weak breath as
    this? No, you are deceived; therefore, back to Rome,              45
    and prepare for your execution: you are condemned; our
    general has sworn you out of reprieve and pardon.

    _Men._ Sirrah, if thy captain knew I were here, he would[3736][3737]
    use me with estimation.[3736]

    _Sec. Sen._ Come, my captain knows you not.[3738]                 50

    _Men._ I mean, thy general.

    _First Sen._ My general cares not for you. Back, I say,
    go; lest I let forth your half-pint of blood;--back,--that's[3739]
    the utmost of your having:--back.[3739]

    _Men._ Nay, but, fellow, fellow,--                                55

               _Enter_ CORIOLANUS _and_ AUFIDIUS.[3740]

    _Cor._ What's the matter?

    _Men._ Now, you companion, I'll say an errand for you:[3741]
    you shall know now that I am in estimation; you shall perceive
    that a Jack guardant cannot office me from my son
    Coriolanus: guess, but by my entertainment with him, if[3742]     60
    thou standest not i' the state of hanging, or of some death
    more long in spectatorship and crueller in suffering; behold
    now presently, and swoon for what's to come upon thee.[3743]
    The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy particular
    prosperity, and love thee no worse than thy old father            65
    Menenius does! O my son, my son! thou art preparing
    fire for us; look thee, here's water to quench it. I was
    hardly moved to come to thee; but being assured none
    but myself could move thee, I have been blown out of
    your gates with sighs; and conjure thee to pardon Rome[3744]      70
    and thy petitionary countrymen. The good gods assuage
    thy wrath, and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet here,--this,[3745]
    who, like a block, hath denied my access to thee.

    _Cor._ Away!

    _Men._ How! away!                                                 75

    _Cor._ Wife, mother, child, I know not. My affairs
    Are servanted to others: though I owe
    My revenge properly, my remission lies[3746]
    In Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar,
    Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison rather[3747]                   80
    Than pity note how much. Therefore be gone.[3748]
    Mine ears against your suits are stronger than
    Your gates against my force. Yet, for I loved thee,
    Take this along; I writ it for thy sake,
    And would have sent it. [_Gives him a letter._] Another
               word, Menenius,[3749]  85
    I will not hear thee speak. This man, Aufidius,
    Was my beloved in Rome: yet thou behold'st.[3750]

    _Auf._ You keep a constant temper.

                               [_Exeunt Coriolanus and Aufidius._[3751]

    _First Sen._ Now, sir, is your name Menenius?

    _Sec. Sen._ 'Tis a spell, you see, of much power: you[3752]       90
    know the way home again.[3752]

    _First Sen._ Do you hear how we are shent for keeping
    your greatness back?

    _Sec. Sen._ What cause, do you think, I have to swoon?[3743]

    _Men._ I neither care for the world nor your general: for         95
    such things as you, I can scarce think there's any, ye're so[3753]
    slight. He that hath a will to die by himself fears it not
    from another: let your general do his worst. For you, be
    that you are, long; and your misery increase with your
    age! I say to you, as I was said to, Away!             [_Exit._  100

    _First Sen._ A noble fellow, I warrant him.

    _Sec. Sen._ The worthy fellow is our general: he's the[3754][3755]
    rock, the oak not to be wind-shaken.          [_Exeunt._[3754][3756]


SCENE III. _The tent of Coriolanus._

           _Enter_ CORIOLANUS, AUFIDIUS, _and others_.[3757]

    _Cor._ We will before the walls of Rome to-morrow
    Set down our host. My partner in this action,
    You must report to the Volscian lords how plainly
    I have borne this business.[3758]

    _Auf._                      Only their ends[3759][3760]
    You have respected; stopp'd your ears against[3759]                5
    The general suit of Rome; never admitted[3759]
    A private whisper, no, not with such friends[3759][3761]
    That thought them sure of you.

    _Cor._                         This last old man,[3762]
    Whom with a crack'd heart I have sent to Rome,
    Loved me above the measure of a father,                           10
    Nay, godded me indeed. Their latest refuge
    Was to send him; for whose old love I have,
    Though I show'd sourly to him, once more offer'd
    The first conditions, which they did refuse[3763]
    And cannot now accept; to grace him only[3764]                    15
    That thought he could do more, a very little[3764]
    I have yielded to: fresh embassies and suits,[3765]
    Nor from the state nor private friends, hereafter[3766]
    Will I lend ear to. [_Shout within._] Ha! what shout is this?[3767]
    Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow                             20
    In the same time 'tis made? I will not.

    _Enter, in mourning habits_, VIRGILIA, VOLUMNIA, _leading young_
               MARCIUS, VALERIA, _and_ Attendants.[3768]

    My wife comes foremost; then the honour'd mould
    Wherein this trunk was framed, and in her hand
    The grandchild to her blood. But out, affection!
    All bond and privilege of nature, break![3769]                    25
    Let it be virtuous to be obstinate.
    What is that curtsy worth? or those doves' eyes,[3770]
    Which can make gods forsworn? I melt, and am not
    Of stronger earth than others. My mother bows;
    As if Olympus to a molehill should                                30
    In supplication nod: and my young boy
    Hath an aspect of intercession, which
    Great nature cries 'Deny not.' Let the Volsces
    Plough Rome, and harrow Italy: I'll never
    Be such a gosling to obey instinct; but stand,                    35
    As if a man were author of himself[3771][3772]
    And knew no other kin.[3772]

    _Vir._                 My lord and husband!

    _Cor._ These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.

    _Vir._ The sorrow that delivers us thus changed
    Makes you think so.

    _Cor._              Like a dull actor now[3773]                   40
    I have forgot my part and I am out,[3773]
    Even to a full disgrace. Best of my flesh,[3773]
    Forgive my tyranny; but do not say,
    For that 'Forgive our Romans.' O, a kiss
    Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge!                            45
    Now, by the jealous queen of heaven, that kiss
    I carried from thee, dear, and my true lip
    Hath virgin'd it e'er since. You gods! I prate,[3774]
    And the most noble mother of the world
    Leave unsaluted: sink, my knee, i' the earth;         [_Kneels._  50
    Of thy deep duty more impression show[3775]
    Than that of common sons.

    _Vol._                    O, stand up blest!
    Whilst, with no softer cushion than the flint,
    I kneel before thee, and unproperly
    Show duty, as mistaken all this while[3776]                       55
    Between the child and parent.                             [_Kneels._

    _Cor._                        What is this?[3777][3778]
    Your knees to me? to your corrected son?[3778]
    Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach[3779]
    Fillip the stars; then let the mutinous winds[3780]
    Strike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun,                    60
    Murdering impossibility, to make
    What cannot be, slight work.

    _Vol._                       Thou art my warrior;[3781]
    I holp to frame thee. Do you know this lady?[3781][3782]

    _Cor._ The noble sister of Publicola,[3783]
    The moon of Rome; chaste as the icicle                            65
    That's curdied by the frost from purest snow[3784]
    And hangs on Dian's temple: dear Valeria!

    _Vol._ This is a poor epitome of yours,[3785]
    Which by the interpretation of full time
    May show like all yourself.

    _Cor._                      The god of soldiers,[3786]            70
    With the consent of supreme Jove, inform
    Thy thoughts with nobleness, that thou mayst prove
    To shame unvulnerable, and stick i' the wars[3787]
    Like a great sea-mark, standing every flaw
    And saving those that eye thee!

    _Vol._                          Your knee, sirrah.[3788]          75

    _Cor._ That's my brave boy!

    _Vol._ Even he, your wife, this lady and myself
    Are suitors to you.

    _Cor._              I beseech you, peace:
    Or, if you'ld ask, remember this before:
    The thing I have forsworn to grant may never[3789]                80
    Be held by you denials. Do not bid me[3789]
    Dismiss my soldiers, or capitulate
    Again with Rome's mechanics: tell me not
    Wherein I seem unnatural: desire not[3790]
    To allay my rages and revenges with[3790]                         85
    Your colder reasons.[3790]

    _Vol._               O, no more, no more!
    You have said you will not grant us any thing;[3791]
    For we have nothing else to ask, but that
    Which you deny already: yet we will ask;
    That, if you fail in our request, the blame[3792]                 90
    May hang upon your hardness: therefore hear us.

    _Cor._ Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark; for we'll
    Hear nought from Rome in private. Your request?

    _Vol._ Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment
    And state of bodies would bewray what life                        95
    We have led since thy exile. Think with thyself[3793]
    How more unfortunate than all living women[3794]
    Are we come hither: since that thy sight, which should[3795]
    Make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance with comforts,[3796]
    Constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow;             100
    Making the mother, wife and child, to see
    The son, the husband and the father, tearing
    His country's bowels out. And to poor we[3797][3798]
    Thine enmity's most capital: thou barr'st us[3798][3799]
    Our prayers to the gods, which is a comfort                      105
    That all but we enjoy; for how can we,
    Alas, how can we for our country pray,
    Whereto we are bound, together with thy victory,[3800]
    Whereto we are bound? alack, or we must lose[3800]
    The country, our dear nurse, or else thy person,                 110
    Our comfort in the country. We must find
    An evident calamity, though we had[3801]
    Our wish, which side should win; for either thou
    Must, as a foreign recreant, be led
    With manacles thorough our streets, or else[3802]                115
    Triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin
    And bear the palm for having bravely shed
    Thy wife and children's blood. For myself, son,
    I purpose not to wait on fortune till
    These wars determine: if I cannot persuade thee[3803]            120
    Rather to show a noble grace to both parts[3804]
    Than seek the end of one, thou shalt no sooner[3805]
    March to assault thy country than to tread--
    Trust to 't, thou shalt not--on thy mother's womb,
    That brought thee to this world.

    _Vir._                           Ay, and mine,[3806][3807]       125
    That brought you forth this boy, to keep your name[3806]
    Living to time.[3806]

    _Boy._          A' shall not tread on me;[3806][3808]
    I'll run away till I am bigger, but then I'll fight.[3806]

    _Cor._ Not of a woman's tenderness to be,
    Requires nor child nor woman's face to see.[3809]                130
    I have sat too long.                                [_Rising._[3810]

    _Vol._               Nay, go not from us thus.
    If it were so that our request did tend
    To save the Romans, thereby to destroy[3811]
    The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us,
    As poisonous of your honour: no; our suit[3812]                  135
    Is, that you reconcile them: while the Volsces
    May say 'This mercy we have show'd,' the Romans,
    'This we received;' and each in either side
    Give the all-hail to thee and cry 'Be blest
    For making up this peace!' Thou know'st, great son,              140
    The end of war's uncertain, but this certain,[3813]
    That if thou conquer Rome, the benefit
    Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name
    Whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses;
    Whose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble,                   145
    But with his last attempt he wiped it out,
    Destroy'd his country, and his name remains
    To the ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son:
    Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour,[3814]
    To imitate the graces of the gods;                               150
    To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air,
    And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt[3815]
    That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?[3816]
    Think'st thou it honourable for a noble man[3817]
    Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:                   155
    He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy:
    Perhaps thy childishness will move him more
    Than can our reasons. There's no man in the world[3818]
    More bound to 's mother, yet here he lets me prate[3819]
    Like one i' the stocks. Thou hast never in thy life[3820]        160
    Show'd thy dear mother any courtesy;
    When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,
    Has cluck'd thee to the wars, and safely home,[3821]
    Loaden with honour. Say my request's unjust,
    And spurn me back: but if it be not so,                          165
    Thou art not honest, and the gods will plague thee,
    That thou restrain'st from me the duty which
    To a mother's part belongs. He turns away:
    Down, ladies; let us shame him with our knees.[3822]
    To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride[3823]                170
    Than pity to our prayers. Down: an end;[3824]
    This is the last: so we will home to Rome,
    And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold's:[3825]
    This boy, that cannot tell what he would have,
    But kneels and holds up hands for fellowship,                    175
    Does reason our petition with more strength
    Than thou hast to deny 't. Come, let us go:
    This fellow had a Volscian to his mother;
    His wife is in Corioli, and his child[3826]
    Like him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch:                    180
    I am hush'd until our city be a-fire,[3827][3828]
    And then I'll speak a little.[3827]

    _Cor._ [_After holding her by the hand, silent_] O Mother, mother![3829]
    What have you done? Behold, the heavens do ope,
    The gods look down, and this unnatural scene
    They laugh at. O my mother, mother! O!                           185
    You have won a happy victory to Rome;[3791]
    But, for your son, believe it, O, believe it,
    Most dangerously you have with him prevail'd,[3830]
    If not most mortal to him. But let it come.[3831]
    Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars,                        190
    I'll frame convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius,[3832]
    Were you in my stead, would you have heard[3833]
    A mother less? or granted less, Aufidius?[3834]

    _Auf._ I was moved withal.[3835]

    _Cor._                     I dare be sworn you were:
    And, sir, it is no little thing to make                          195
    Mine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good sir,
    What peace you'll make, advise me: for my part,
    I'll not to Rome, I'll back with you; and pray you,
    Stand to me in this cause. O mother! wife!

    _Auf._ [_Aside_] I am glad thou hast set thy mercy and thy honour[3836]  200
    At difference in thee: out of that I'll work
    Myself a former fortune.     [_The Ladies make signs to Coriolanus._

    _Cor._ [_To Volumnia, Virgilia, &c._] Ay, by and by:--[3837][3838]
    But we will drink together; and you shall bear[3838][3839]
    A better witness back than words, which we
    On like conditions will have counter-seal'd.                     205
    Come, enter with us. Ladies, you deserve[3840]
    To have a temple built you: all the swords[3840]
    In Italy, and her confederate arms,[3840]
    Could not have made this peace.                     [_Exeunt._[3840]


SCENE IV. _Rome. A public place._[3841]

                    _Enter_ MENENIUS _and_ SICINIUS.

    _Men._ See you yond coign o' the Capitol, yond
    cornerstone?

    _Sic._ Why, what of that?

    _Men._ If it be possible for you to displace it with your
    little finger, there is some hope the ladies of Rome, especially   5
    his mother, may prevail with him. But I say there
    is no hope in 't: our throats are sentenced, and stay upon
    execution.

    _Sic._ Is't possible that so short a time can alter the
    condition of a man?                                               10

    _Men._ There is differency between a grub and a butterfly;[3842]
    yet your butterfly was a grub. This Marcius is grown
    from man to dragon: he has wings; he's more than a
    creeping thing.

    _Sic._ He loved his mother dearly.                                15

    _Men._ So did he me: and he no more remembers his
    mother now than an eight-year-old horse. The tartness of[3843]
    his face sours ripe grapes: when he walks, he moves like
    an engine, and the ground shrinks before his treading: he
    is able to pierce a corslet with his eye; talks like a knell,     20
    and his hum is a battery. He sits in his state, as a thing[3844][3845]
    made for Alexander. What he bids be done, is finished[3845]
    with his bidding. He wants nothing of a god but eternity
    and a heaven to throne in.

    _Sic._ Yes, mercy, if you report him truly.                       25

    _Men._ I paint him in the character. Mark what mercy
    his mother shall bring from him: there is no more mercy
    in him than there is milk in a male tiger; that shall our
    poor city find: and all this is long of you.[3846]

    _Sic._ The gods be good unto us!                                  30

    _Men._ No, in such a case the gods will not be good
    unto us. When we banished him, we respected not them;
    and, he returning to break our necks, they respect not us.

                          _Enter a_ Messenger.

    _Mess._ Sir, if you'ld save your life, fly to your house:
    The plebeians have got your fellow-tribune,                       35
    And hale him up and down, all swearing, if
    The Roman ladies bring not comfort home,
    They'll give him death by inches.

                       _Enter another_ Messenger.

    _Sic._                            What's the news?

    _Sec. Mess._ Good news, good news; the ladies have prevail'd,[3847]
    The Volscians are dislodged, and Marcius gone:                    40
    A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,
    No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins.

    _Sic._                                 Friend,[3848]
    Art thou certain this is true? is it most certain?[3848][3849]

    _Sec. Mess._ As certain as I know the sun is fire:[3847]
    Where have you lurk'd, that you make doubt of it?                 45
    Ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide,
    As the recomforted through the gates. Why, hark you!

                  [_Trumpets; hautboys; drums beat; all together._[3850]

    The trumpets, sackbuts, psalteries and fifes,
    Tabors and cymbals and the shouting Romans,[3851]
    Make the sun dance. Hark you!               [_A shout within._[3852]

    _Men._                        This is good news:                  50
    I will go meet the ladies. This Volumnia[3853]
    Is worth of consuls, senators, patricians,
    A city full; of tribunes, such as you,
    A sea and land full. You have pray'd well to-day:[3854]
    This morning for ten thousand of your throats                     55
    I'ld not have given a doit. Hark, how they joy!

                                      [_Music still, with shouts._[3855]

    _Sic._ First, the gods bless you for your tidings; next,[3856]
    Accept my thankfulness.[3856]

    _Sec. Mess._            Sir, we have all[3857]
    Great cause to give great thanks.[3857]

    _Sic._                            They are near the city?[3857][3858]

    _Sec. Mess._ Almost at point to enter.[3857]

    _Sic._                      We will meet them,[3857][3859][3860]  60
    And help the joy.                       [_Exeunt._[3857][3860][3861]


SCENE V. _The same. A street near the gate._

 _Enter two_ Senators _with_ VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, VALERIA, _&c. passing
      over the stage, followed by_ Patricians _and others_.[3862]

    _First Sen._ Behold our patroness, the life of Rome![3863]
    Call all your tribes together, praise the gods,[3864]
    And make triumphant fires; strew flowers before them:[3865]
    Unshout the noise that banish'd Marcius,[3866]
    Repeal him with the welcome of his mother;                         5
    Cry 'Welcome, ladies, welcome!'

    _All._                          Welcome, ladies,[3867]
    Welcome!  [_A flourish with drums and trumpets. Exeunt._[3867][3868]


SCENE VI. _Antium. A public place._[3869]

              _Enter_ TULLUS AUFIDIUS, _with_ Attendants.

    _Auf._ Go tell the lords o' the city I am here:[3870]
    Deliver them this paper: having read it,
    Bid them repair to the market-place, where I,
    Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
    Will vouch the truth of it. Him I accuse[3871]                     5
    The city ports by this hath enter'd, and
    Intends to appear before the people, hoping
    To purge himself with words: dispatch.   [_Exeunt Attendants._[3872]

      _Enter three or four_ Conspirators _of_ AUFIDIUS' _faction_.

    Most welcome!

    _First Con._ How is it with our general?

    _Auf._                                    Even so[3873]           10
    As with a man by his own alms empoison'd,[3873]
    And with his charity slain.[3873]

    _Sec. Con._                 Most noble sir,[3874]
    If you do hold the same intent wherein[3874]
    You wish'd us parties, we'll deliver you[3874]
    Of your great danger.

    _Auf._                Sir, I cannot tell:                         15
    We must proceed as we do find the people.

    _Third Con._ The people will remain uncertain whilst
    'Twixt you there's difference; but the fall of either
    Makes the survivor heir of all.

    _Auf._                          I know it,
    And my pretext to strike at him admits                            20
    A good construction. I raised him, and I pawn'd[3875]
    Mine honour for his truth: who being so heighten'd,
    He water'd his new plants with dews of flattery,[3876]
    Seducing so my friends; and, to this end,
    He bow'd his nature, never known before                           25
    But to be rough, unswayable and free.[3877]

    _Third Con._ Sir, his stoutness[3878]
    When he did stand for consul, which he lost
    By lack of stooping,--[3879]

    _Auf._                 That I would have spoke of:
    Being banish'd for't, he came unto my hearth;                     30
    Presented to my knife his throat: I took him,
    Made him joint-servant with me, gave him way
    In all his own desires, nay, let him choose
    Out of my files, his projects to accomplish,[3880]
    My best and freshest men, served his designments                  35
    In mine own person, holp to reap the fame[3881][3882]
    Which he did end all his; and took some pride[3882][3883]
    To do myself this wrong: till at the last
    I seem'd his follower, not partner, and
    He waged me with his countenance, as if[3884]                     40
    I had been mercenary.

    _First Con._          So he did, my lord:
    The army marvell'd at it, and in the last,[3885]
    When he had carried Rome and that we look'd
    For no less spoil than glory--[3886]

    _Auf._                         There was it:
    For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him.[3887]            45
    At a few drops of women's rheum, which are
    As cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labour
    Of our great action: therefore shall he die,
    And I'll renew me in his fall. But hark!

     [_Drums and trumpets sound, with great shouts of the people._[3888]

    _First Con._ Your native town you enter'd like a post,            50
    And had no welcomes home; but he returns,
    Splitting the air with noise.

    _Sec. Con._                   And patient fools,
    Whose children he hath slain, their base throats tear
    With giving him glory.[3889]

    _Third Con._           Therefore, at your vantage,
    Ere he express himself, or move the people                        55
    With what he would say, let him feel your sword,
    Which we will second. When he lies along,[3890][3891]
    After your way his tale pronounced shall bury[3891]
    His reasons with his body.

    _Auf._                     Say no more:[3892]
    Here come the lords.[3892]                                        60

                    _Enter the_ Lords _of the city_.

    _All the Lords._ You are most welcome home.[3893]

    _Auf._                                      I have not deserved it.
    But, worthy lords, have you with heed perused
    What I have written to you?

    _Lords._                    We have.

    _First Lord._                        And grieve to hear 't.[3894]
    What faults he made before the last, I think
    Might have found easy fines: but there to end                     65
    Where he was to begin, and give away
    The benefit of our levies, answering us
    With our own charge, making a treaty where
    There was a yielding,--this admits no excuse.[3895]

    _Auf._ He approaches: you shall hear him.                         70

   _Enter_ CORIOLANUS, _marching with drum and colours; the commoners
                            being with him_.

    _Cor._ Hail, lords! I am return'd your soldier;[3896]
    No more infected with my country's love
    Than when I parted hence, but still subsisting
    Under your great command. You are to know,
    That prosperously I have attempted and                            75
    With bloody passage led your wars even to
    The gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home[3897]
    Do more than counterpoise a full third part[3897]
    The charges of the action. We have made peace,[3898]
    With no less honour to the Antiates                               80
    Than shame to the Romans: and we here deliver,[3899]
    Subscribed by the consuls and patricians,[3900]
    Together with the seal o' the senate, what[3901]
    We have compounded on.

    _Auf._                 Read it not, noble lords;
    But tell the traitor, in the highest degree                       85
    He hath abused your powers.

    _Cor._ Traitor! how now!

    _Auf._                   Ay, traitor, Marcius!

    _Cor._                                         Marcius!

    _Auf._ Ay, Marcius, Caius Marcius: dost thou think
    I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol'n name
    Coriolanus, in Corioli?                                           90
    You lords and heads o' the state, perfidiously[3901][3902]
    He has betray'd your business, and given up,
    For certain drops of salt, your city Rome,
    I say 'your city,' to his wife and mother;
    Breaking his oath and resolution, like                            95
    A twist of rotten silk; never admitting
    Counsel o' the war; but at his nurse's tears[3901]
    He whined and roar'd away your victory;
    That pages blush'd at him and men of heart
    Look'd wondering each at other.[3903]

    _Cor._                          Hear'st thou, Mars?              100

    _Auf._ Name not the god, thou boy of tears!

    _Cor._                                      Ha!

    _Auf._ No more.[3904]

    _Cor._ Measureless liar, thou hast made my heart
    Too great for what contains it. 'Boy!' O slave!
    Pardon me, lords, 'tis the first time that ever[3905]            105
    I was forced to scold. Your judgements, my grave lords,[3905][3906]
    Must give this cur the lie: and his own notion--
    Who wears my stripes impress'd upon him; that
    Must bear my beating to his grave--shall join
    To thrust the lie unto him.                                      110

    _First Lord._ Peace, both, and hear me speak.

    _Cor._ Cut me to pieces, Volsces; men and lads,[3907]
    Stain all your edges on me. 'Boy!' false hound![3908]
    If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there,
    That, like an eagle in a dove-cote, I                            115
    Flutter'd your Volscians in Corioli;[3909]
    Alone I did it. 'Boy!'[3910]

    _Auf._                 Why, noble lords,
    Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune,
    Which was your shame, by this unholy braggart,
    'Fore your own eyes and ears?

    _All Consp._                  Let him die for't.                 120

    _All the People._ 'Tear him to pieces.' 'Do it presently.'[3911][3912]
    'He killed my son.' 'My daughter.' 'He killed my cousin[3912][3913]
    Marcus.' 'He killed my father.'[3912][3913]

    _Sec. Lord._ Peace, ho! no outrage: peace![3914]
    The man is noble, and his fame folds-in                          125
    This orb o' the earth. His last offences to us
    Shall have judicious hearing. Stand, Aufidius,
    And trouble not the peace.

    _Cor._                     O that I had him,[3915]
    With six Aufidiuses, or more, his tribe,[3915]
    To use my lawful sword![3915]

    _Auf._                  Insolent villain!                        130

    _All Consp._ Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill him!

                          [_The Conspirators draw, and kill Coriolanus:
                                    Aufidius stands on his body._[3916]

    _Lords._                                       Hold, hold, hold, hold!

    _Auf._ My noble masters, hear me speak.

    _First Lord._                           O Tullus,--[3917]

    _Sec. Lord._ Thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep.[3918]

    _Third Lord._ Tread not upon him. Masters all, be quiet;[3919]
    Put up your swords.                                              135

    _Auf._ My lords, when you shall know--as in this rage[3920]
    Provoked by him, you cannot--the great danger[3921]
    Which this man's life did owe you, you'll rejoice
    That he is thus cut off. Please it your honours
    To call me to your senate, I'll deliver                          140
    Myself your loyal servant, or endure
    Your heaviest censure.

    _First Lord._          Bear from hence his body;
    And mourn you for him: let him be regarded
    As the most noble corse that ever herald
    Did follow to his urn.

    _Sec. Lord._           His own impatience                        145
    Takes from Aufidius a great part of blame.
    Let's make the best of it.

    _Auf._                     My rage is gone,
    And I am struck with sorrow. Take him up:
    Help, three o' the chiefest soldiers; I'll be one.[3901]
    Beat thou the drum, that it speak mournfully:                    150
    Trail your steel pikes. Though in this city he
    Hath widow'd and unchilded many a one,
    Which to this hour bewail the injury,
    Yet he shall have a noble memory.[3922]
    Assist.  [_Exeunt, bearing the body of Coriolanus._[3922][3923]  155
                                            _A dead march sounded._

NOTES.


NOTE I.

I. 1. 108-117. In Singer's edition of 1826 these speeches were
distributed in the following manner:

    '_Men._ The kingly-crowned ...
                                  ... if that they--

    _1 Cit._                                        What then?

    _Men._ 'Fore me ...
                       ... body,--

    _1 Cit._                      Well, what then?
             The former ...
                           ... answer?

In his edition of 1856 the ordinary arrangement is silently given.


NOTE II.

I. 3. 41. The first Folio reads:

    'At Grecian sword. _Contenning_, tell _Valeria_' &c.

as if 'Contenning' were the name of the gentlewoman in attendance.

The second has:

    'At Grecian swordes _Contending_: tell _Valeria_' &c.

The third:

    'At Grecian swords Contending: tell Valeria' &c.

The fourth:

    'At _Grecian_ swords contending: tell _Valeria_' &c.

which is followed substantially by all editors before Capell.

Capell reads:

    'At Grecian swords' contending.--Tell _Valeria_' &c.

which is adopted in subsequent editions down to that of Mr Knight,
inclusive.

Mr Collier, in his first edition, gave:

    'At Grecian sword's contending.--Tell Valeria' &c.

at the same time offering as a conjecture:

    'At Grecian swords, contemning.'

This was afterwards found among the MS. corrections of his second Folio
and adopted by Mr Singer, as well as by Mr Collier himself in his
second edition.

The reading we have given in the text was first adopted by Dr Leo. He,
however, puts no comma after 'sword.'

Mr Keightley gives the same reading, marking, however, a break in the
sense, thus:

    'At Grecian sword, contemning.... Tell Valeria' &c.

Mr Lettsom conjectures:

    'As Grecian swords contemning.'

Perhaps we might read:

    'At Grecian sword, contemning 't.'

It has also been suggested to us that '_Contenning_' is the remnant of
a stage-direction [_containing herself_]. But we know of no similar
instance in any old edition.


NOTE III.

I. 4. 31. A copy of the second Folio, which was in the possession of Mr
Singer, is said to have 'a Heard,' not 'you Heard.'

Malone, in his Supplement to Steevens's edition of 1778, proposed to
read:

        'You shames of Rome, you! hoards of boils and plagues
    Plaister you o'er.'


NOTE IV.

I. 9. 41-53. Theobald, at Warburton's suggestion, read the whole speech
as follows:

    '_Mar._ May these same Instruments, which you profane,
    Never sound more! when drums and trumpets shall
    I' th' field prove flatterers, let camps, as cities,
    Be made of false-fac'd soothing! When Steel grows
    Soft, as the parasite's silk, let Hymns be made
    An overture for th' wars!--No more, I say;
    For that I have not wash'd my Nose that bled,
    Or foil'd some debile wretch, which, without note
    Here's many else have done; you shout me forth
    In acclamations hyperbolical;
    As if I lov'd, my little should be dieted
    In praises, sauc'd with lies.'

Subsequent editors partly followed Theobald's arrangement, without
adopting his readings.

Mr Knight printed as follows:

    'May these same instruments which you profane,
    Never sound more, when drums and trumpets shall
    I' the field prove flatterers! Let courts and cities be
    Made all of false-fac'd soothing, where steel grows soft
    As the parasite's silk!
    Let them be made an overture for the wars!' &c.

Hudson follows Knight, but reads _where steel ... silk_ as one line.
Singer proposed to read and print thus:

    'May these same instruments, which you profane,
    Never sound more! shall drums and trumpets, when
    I' the field, prove flatterers? (Let courts and cities be
    Made all of false-faced soothing,
    When steel grows soft as the Parasite's silk)--
    Let them be made an overture for the wars!--
    No more! I say,' &c.

In his _Text of Shakespeare Vindicated_, &c. (1853) he arranged the
first four lines as in our text, and in the two following read
_silks ... them_.


NOTE V.

II. 3. 236-238. The Folios here read:

                              'hither,
    And Nobly nam'd, so twice being Censor,
    Was his great Ancestor.'

Rowe, in his first edition, reads:

                                'hither,
    And, nobly nam'd _Martius_, so, twice being Censor,
    Was his great Ancestor.'

In his second edition he reads:

                              'hither
    And nobly nam'd; so, twice being Censor,
    Was his great Ancestor.'

Pope reads:

                                  'hither.
    †And _Censorinus_, darling of the people
    (And nobly nam'd so for twice being censor)
    Was his great ancestor.'

In his note on the passage he says, "This verse I have supply'd. A line
having been certainly left out in this place, as will appear to any
one who consults the beginning of Plutarch's life of Coriolanus, from
whence this passage is directly translated."

Notwithstanding that the words 'darling of the people' are not in the
passage referred to, the line inserted by Pope was accepted by all
subsequent editors down to Singer.

Steevens, in his edition of 1773, omitted 'for' in the second line; and
in his edition of 1793, instead of 'twice being censor' read 'being
censor twice.'

Singer (ed. 1856) reads:

                              'hither;
    [One of that family nam'd Censorinus]
    And nobly nam'd so, twice being chosen Censor,
    Was his great ancestor.'

Mr Grant White adopts Pope's insertion, and follows Singer in reading
'chosen' in the next line.

Dr Delius reads:

                              'hither;
    [And Censorinus, that was so surnam'd,]
    And nobly named so, twice being censor,
    Was his great ancestor.'

He remarks that 'darling of the people' does not sound like Shakespeare.

Dr Leo reads:

                              'hither;
    [And Censorinus, nam'd so by the people,]
    And nobly named so, twice being censor,
    Was his great ancestor.'

Mr Keightley reads:

                              'hither;
    _And Censorinus, he that was so nam'd_,
    --And nobly nam'd so, twice being Censor--
    Was his great ancestor.'

Dr Nicholson conjectures that the line omitted was:

    'And he that was surnamed Censorinus.'

The passage from Plutarch, to which Pope refers, stands as follows
in North's translation of the Lives, p. 235, (ed. 1595): 'Of the same
house were _Publius, & Quintus_, who brought to ROME their best water
they had by conduites. _Censorinus_ also came of that familie, that was
so surnamed, because the people had chosen him _Censor_ twise.'

The reading we have given in the text was first adopted by us in the
Globe Edition. It leaves the words of the Folios still in their order,
and introduces what must have been the significant fact that Censorinus
was chosen 'by the people.' A stain or rent in the copy might have
rendered parts of two lines illegible, the remainder being unskilfully
pieced together by transcriber or printer.


NOTE VI.

III. 1. 97-101. Hanmer, followed by Capell, reads:

                              'If they have power,
    Let them have cushions by you: if none, awake
    Your dang'rous lenity: if you are learned,
    Be not as common fools: if you are not,
    Then vail your ignorance.'

In line 98, where Mr Collier, from his MS. corrector, reads 'impotence'
for 'ignorance', Warburton interprets 'ignorance' as 'impotence;
because it makes impotent.'


NOTE VII.

III. 1. 185-188. All editors follow the Folios in assigning the words
'Weapons, weapons, weapons!' to the second senator, and all, except
Capell, continue the words 'Tribunes ... citizens!' to the same
speaker. Capell assigned them to the First Senator. But surely the
words are intended to express the tumultuous cries of the partisans
on both sides, who are bustling about Coriolanus. The following words
'Peace, peace, peace' ... attributed to 'All' in the Folios, are spoken
by some of the elder Senators endeavouring to calm the tumult.

Compare also Act V. Sc. 6. 121-123. There is a similar stage direction
of the Folio, which was similarly misinterpreted, in _The Tempest_, I.
1. 57-59.


NOTE VIII.

III. 2. 105. Malone (1790) says 'The word _as_ has been substituted for
_which_ by the modern editors in the passage before us.' We have been
unable to find it in Rowe, Pope, Theobald, Hanmer, Warburton, Johnson,
Capell, or Steevens. It is probably a printer's emendation in some of
the numerous reprints of the play.


NOTE IX.

IV. 5. 130. Mr Collier, in a note to this passage, says that the Earl
of Ellesmere's copy of the first Folio has 'o'er-beare.' Mr Staunton,
to whom the volume has been lent, has kindly consulted it for us, and
says that the reading there is 'o're beate' or 'o're beare.' He adds
'It is difficult to say which. There are other cases in the Folio where
the _t_ and _r_ so nearly resemble each other that I can hardly decide
between them.'


NOTE X.

V. 1. 17. Mr Collier explains his reading by the following note:
'Menenius intends to say that the tribunes have wrecked a noble memory
for Rome by occasioning its destruction.'


NOTE XI.

V. 3. 75. Dr Nicholson writes to us: 'The stage action here to which
Coriolanus replies is this: the boy refuses to kneel, but interposes
between the kneeling ladies and Coriolanus. See his after speech
'A' shall not tread on me,' &c. This, if not introduced as a stage
direction, ought to be explained in a note.' To us Coriolanus seems
rather to commend the boy for doing as he was bid. To refuse to kneel
would suit ill with his 'aspect of intercession' (line 32). Besides, he
kneels, without being specially told to do so, afterwards (line 175).

ACT I.


SCENE I. _Rome. Before the Capitol. The Tomb of the Andronici
appearing._

    _Flourish. Enter the_ Tribunes _and_ Senators _aloft. And then
        enter below_, SATURNINUS _and his_ Followers _from one
        side, and_ BASSIANUS _and his_ Followers _from the other
        side, with drum and colours_.[3924]

    _Sat._ Noble patricians, patrons of my right,
    Defend the justice of my cause with arms;
    And, countrymen, my loving followers,[3925]
    Plead my successive title with your swords:
    I am his first-born son, that was the last[3926]                   5
    That ware the imperial diadem of Rome;[3926]
    Then let my father's honours live in me,
    Nor wrong mine age with this indignity.

    _Bas._ Romans, friends, followers, favourers of my right,[3927]
    If ever Bassianus, Cæsar's son,                                   10
    Were gracious in the eyes of royal Rome,
    Keep then this passage to the Capitol;
    And suffer not dishonour to approach
    The imperial seat, to virtue consecrate,[3928]
    To justice, continence and nobility:[3929]                        15
    But let desert in pure election shine;
    And, Romans, fight for freedom in your choice.

       _Enter_ MARCUS ANDRONICUS, _aloft, with the crown_.[3930]

    _Marc._ Princes, that strive by factions and by friends[3931]
    Ambitiously for rule and empery,
    Know that the people of Rome, for whom we stand                   20
    A special party, have by common voice,
    In election for the Roman empery,[3932]
    Chosen Andronicus, surnamed Pius[3933]
    For many good and great deserts to Rome:
    A nobler man, a braver warrior,                                   25
    Lives not this day within the city walls:[3934]
    He by the senate is accited home
    From weary wars against the barbarous Goths;
    That, with his sons, a terror to our foes,
    Hath yoked a nation strong, train'd up in arms.                   30
    Ten years are spent since first he undertook
    This cause of Rome, and chastised with arms
    Our enemies' pride: five times he hath return'd
    Bleeding to Rome, bearing his valiant sons
    In coffins from the field.[3935]                                  35
    And now at last, laden with honour's spoils,
    Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,
    Renowned Titus, flourishing in arms.
    Let us entreat, by honour of his name,
    Whom worthily you would have now succeed,[3936]                   40
    And in the Capitol and senate's right,
    Whom you pretend to honour and adore,
    That you withdraw you and abate your strength,
    Dismiss your followers and, as suitors should,
    Plead your deserts in peace and humbleness.                       45

    _Sat._ How fair the tribune speaks to calm my thoughts![3937]

    _Bas._ Marcus Andronicus, so I do affy
    In thy uprightness and integrity,
    And so I love and honour thee and thine,
    Thy noble Titus and his sons,                                     50
    And her to whom my thoughts are humbled all,[3938]
    Gracious Lavinia, Rome's rich ornament,
    That I will here dismiss my loving friends,
    And to my fortunes and the people's favour[3939]
    Commit my cause in balance to be weigh'd.

                         [_Exeunt the Followers of Bassianus._[3940]  55

    _Sat._ Friends, that have been thus forward in my right,[3941]
    I thank you all, and here dismiss you all,
    And to the love and favour of my country
    Commit myself, my person and the cause.

                            [_Exeunt the Followers of Saturninus._[3942]

    Rome, be as just and gracious unto me                             60
    As I am confident and kind to thee.
    Open the gates, and let me in.[3943]

    _Bas._ Tribunes, and me, a poor competitor.

                              [_Flourish. Saturninus and Bassianus go up
                                                into the Capitol._[3944]

                           _Enter a_ Captain.

    _Cap._ Romans, make way: the good Andronicus,[3945]
    Patron of virtue, Rome's best champion,                           65
    Successful in the battles that he fights,
    With honour and with fortune is return'd
    From where he circumscribed with his sword,[3946]
    And brought to yoke, the enemies of Rome.

    _Drums and trumpets sounded. Enter_ MARTIUS _and_ MUTIUS;
        _after them, two_ Men _bearing a coffin covered with black;
        then_ LUCIUS _and_ QUINTUS. _After them_, TITUS ANDRONICUS;
        _and then_ TAMORA Queen of Goths, _with_ ALARBUS,
        DEMETRIUS, CHIRON, AARON, _and other_ Goths, _prisoners_;
        Soldiers _and_ People _following. The_ Bearers _set down
        the coffin, and_ TITUS _speaks_.[3947]

    _Tit._ Hail, Rome, victorious in thy mourning weeds![3948]        70
    Lo, as the bark that hath discharged her fraught[3949]
    Returns with precious lading to the bay
    From whence at first she weigh'd her anchorage,
    Cometh Andronicus, bound with laurel boughs,[3950]
    To re-salute his country with his tears,                          75
    Tears of true joy for his return to Rome.
    Thou great defender of this Capitol,
    Stand gracious to the rites that we intend![3951]
    Romans, of five and twenty valiant sons,
    Half of the number that King Priam had,                           80
    Behold the poor remains, alive and dead!
    These that survive let Rome reward with love;
    These that I bring unto their latest home,
    With burial amongst their ancestors:[3952]
    Here Goths have given me leave to sheathe my sword.               85
    Titus, unkind, and careless of thine own,
    Why suffer'st thou thy sons, unburied yet,
    To hover on the dreadful shore of Styx?
    Make way to lay them by their brethren.[3953]

                                                  [_They open the tomb._

    There greet in silence, as the dead are wont,[3954]               90
    And sleep in peace, slain in your country's wars!
    O sacred receptacle of my joys,[3955]
    Sweet cell of virtue and nobility,
    How many sons hast thou of mine in store,[3956]
    That thou wilt never render to me more!                           95

    _Luc._ Give us the proudest prisoner of the Goths,
    That we may hew his limbs and on a pile
    'Ad manes fratrum' sacrifice his flesh,[3957]
    Before this earthy prison of their bones,[3958]
    That so the shadows be not unappeased,[3959]                     100
    Nor we disturb'd with prodigies on earth.

    _Tit._ I give him you, the noblest that survives,
    The eldest son of this distressed queen.[3960]

    _Tam._ Stay, Roman brethren! Gracious conqueror,[3961]
    Victorious Titus, rue the tears I shed,[3962]                    105
    A mother's tears in passion for her son:
    And if thy sons were ever dear to thee,
    O, think my son to be as dear to me![3963]
    Sufficeth not, that we are brought to Rome,
    To beautify thy triumphs and return,[3964]                       110
    Captive to thee and to thy Roman yoke;
    But must my sons be slaughter'd in the streets,[3965]
    For valiant doings in their country's cause?
    O, if to fight for king and commonweal
    Were piety in thine, it is in these.                             115
    Andronicus, stain not thy tomb with blood.
    Wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods?
    Draw near them then in being merciful:
    Sweet mercy is nobility's true badge:
    Thrice-noble Titus, spare my first-born son.                     120

    _Tit._ Patient yourself, madam, and pardon me.
    These are their brethren, whom you Goths beheld[3966]
    Alive and dead; and for their brethren slain[3953]
    Religiously they ask a sacrifice:
    To this your son is mark'd, and die he must,                     125
    To appease their groaning shadows that are gone.[3967]

    _Luc._ Away with him! and make a fire straight;
    And with our swords, upon a pile of wood,
    Let's hew his limbs till they be clean consumed.

                     [_Exeunt the sons of Andronicus with Alarbus_[3968]

    _Tam._ O cruel, irreligious piety!                               130

    _Chi._ Was ever Scythia half so barbarous?

    _Tam._ Oppose not Scythia to ambitious Rome.[3969]
    Alarbus goes to rest, and we survive[3970]
    To tremble under Titus' threatening look.[3971]
    Then, madam, stand resolved; but hope withal,                    135
    The self-same gods that arm'd the Queen of Troy
    With opportunity of sharp revenge
    Upon the Thracian tyrant in his tent,[3972]
    May favour Tamora, the queen of Goths,
    When Goths were Goths and Tamora was queen,                      140
    To quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes.[3973]

  _Re-enter the sons of_ ANDRONICUS, _with their swords bloody_.[3974]

    _Luc._ See, lord and father, how we have perform'd
    Our Roman rites: Alarbus' limbs are lopp'd,[3975]
    And entrails feed the sacrificing fire,[3976]
    Whose smoke, like incense, doth perfume the sky.                 145
    Remaineth nought but to inter our brethren
    And with loud 'larums welcome them to Rome.

    _Tit._ Let it be so; and let Andronicus
    Make this his latest farewell to their souls.

             [_Trumpets sounded, and the coffin laid in the tomb._[3977]

    In peace and honour rest you here, my sons;[3978]                150
    Rome's readiest champions, repose you here in rest,[3979]
    Secure from worldly chances and mishaps!
    Here lurks no treason, here no envy swells,
    Here grow no damned drugs; here are no storms,[3980]
    No noise, but silence and eternal sleep:                         155
    In peace and honour rest you here, my sons!

                         _Enter_ LAVINIA.[3981]

    _Lav._ In peace and honour live Lord Titus long;[3982]
    My noble lord and father, live in fame!
    Lo, at this tomb my tributary tears
    I render, for my brethren's obsequies;[3953]                     160
    And at thy feet I kneel, with tears of joy
    Shed on the earth, for thy return to Rome:
    O, bless me here with thy victorious hand,
    Whose fortunes Rome's best citizens applaud![3983]

    _Tit._ Kind Rome, that hast thus lovingly reserved[3984]         165
    The cordial of mine age to glad my heart![3985]
    Lavinia, live; outlive thy father's days,
    And fame's eternal date, for virtue's praise!

      _Enter, below,_ MARCUS ANDRONICUS _and_ Tribunes; _re-enter_
             SATURNINUS _and_ BASSIANUS, _attended_.[3986]

    _Marc._ Long live Lord Titus, my beloved brother,
    Gracious triumpher in the eyes of Rome!                          170

    _Tit._   Thanks, gentle tribune, noble brother Marcus.[3987]

    _Marc._ And welcome, nephews, from successful wars,
    You that survive, and you that sleep in fame!
    Fair lords, your fortunes are alike in all,
    That in your country's service drew your swords:                 175
    But safer triumph is this funeral pomp,
    That hath aspired to Solon's happiness,
    And triumphs over chance in honour's bed.
    Titus Andronicus, the people of Rome,
    Whose friend in justice thou hast ever been,                     180
    Send thee by me, their tribune and their trust,[3988]
    This palliament of white and spotless hue;
    And name thee in election for the empire,
    With these our late-deceased emperor's sons:[3989]
    Be candidatus then, and put it on,                               185
    And help to set a head on headless Rome.

    _Tit._ A better head her glorious body fits
    Than his that shakes for age and feebleness:
    What should I don this robe, and trouble you?[3990]
    Be chosen with proclamations to-day,[3991]                       190
    To-morrow yield up rule, resign my life,
    And set abroad new business for you all?[3992]
    Rome, I have been thy soldier forty years,
    And led my country's strength successfully,
    And buried one and twenty valiant sons,                          195
    Knighted in field, slain manfully in arms,
    In right and service of their noble country:
    Give me a staff of honour for mine age,
    But not a sceptre to control the world:
    Upright he held it, lords, that held it last.                    200

    _Marc._ Titus, thou shalt obtain and ask the empery.[3993]

    _Sat._ Proud and ambitious tribune, canst thou tell?

    _Tit._ Patience, Prince Saturninus.[3994]

    _Sat._                              Romans, do me right;
    Patricians, draw your swords, and sheathe them not
    Till Saturninus be Rome's emperor.                               205
    Andronicus, would thou wert shipp'd to hell,
    Rather than rob me of the people's hearts!

    _Luc._ Proud Saturnine, interrupter of the good
    That noble-minded Titus means to thee!

    _Tit._ Content thee, prince; I will restore to thee              210
    The people's hearts, and wean them from themselves.

    _Bas._ Andronicus, I do not flatter thee,
    But honour thee, and will do till I die:
    My faction if thou strengthen with thy friends,[3995]
    I will most thankful be; and thanks to men                       215
    Of noble minds is honourable meed.

    _Tit._ People of Rome, and people's tribunes here,[3996]
    I ask your voices and your suffrages:
    Will you bestow them friendly on Andronicus?

    _Tribunes._ To gratify the good Andronicus,[3997]                220
    And gratulate his safe return to Rome,
    The people will accept whom he admits.

    _Tit._ Tribunes, I thank you: and this suit I make,[3998]
    That you create your emperor's eldest son,
    Lord Saturnine; whose virtues will, I hope,                      225
    Reflect on Rome as Titan's rays on earth,
    And ripen justice in this commonweal:
    Then, if you will elect by my advice,[3999]
    Crown him, and say 'Long live our emperor!'

    _Marc._ With voices and applause of every sort,[4000]            230
    Patricians and plebeians, we create[4001]
    Lord Saturninus Rome's great emperor,
    And say 'Long live our Emperor Saturnine!'

                           [_A long flourish till they come down._[4002]

    _Sat._ Titus Andronicus, for thy favours done
    To us in our election this day,                                  235
    I give thee thanks in part of thy deserts,
    And will with deeds requite thy gentleness:
    And, for an onset, Titus, to advance
    Thy name and honourable family,
    Lavinia will I make my empress,[4003]                            240
    Rome's royal mistress, mistress of my heart,
    And in the sacred Pantheon her espouse:[4004]
    Tell me, Andronicus, doth this motion please thee?

    _Tit._ It doth, my worthy lord; and in this match
    I hold me highly honour'd of your grace:[4005]                   245
    And here, in sight of Rome, to Saturnine,[4006]
    King and commander of our commonweal,
    The wide world's emperor, do I consecrate
    My sword, my chariot and my prisoners;
    Presents well worthy Rome's imperious lord:[4007]                250
    Receive them then, the tribute that I owe,
    Mine honour's ensigns humbled at thy feet.[4008]

    _Sat._ Thanks, noble Titus, father of my life!
    How proud I am of thee and of thy gifts,
    Rome shall record; and when I do forget                          255
    The least of these unspeakable deserts,
    Romans, forget your fealty to me.

    _Tit._ [_To Tamora_] Now, madam, are you prisoner to an emperor;[4009]
    To him that, for your honour and your state,[4010]
    Will use you nobly and your followers.                           260

    _Sat._ A goodly lady, trust me; of the hue[4011][4012]
    That I would choose, were I to choose anew.[4011][4013]
    Clear up, fair queen, that cloudy countenance:
    Though chance of war hath wrought this change of cheer,[4014]
    Thou comest not to be made a scorn in Rome:                      265
    Princely shall be thy usage every way.
    Rest on my word, and let not discontent
    Daunt all your hopes: madam, he comforts you[4015]
    Can make you greater than the Queen of Goths.[4016]
    Lavinia, you are not displeased with this?[4017]                 270

    _Lav._ Not I, my lord; sith true nobility
    Warrants these words in princely courtesy.[4018]

    _Sat._ Thanks, sweet Lavinia. Romans, let us go:
    Ransomless here we set our prisoners free:
    Proclaim our honours, lords, with trump and drum.                275

               [_Flourish. Saturninus courts Tamora in dumb show._[4019]

    _Bas._ [_Seizing Lavinia_] Lord Titus, by your leave,
              this maid is mine.[4020]

    _Tit._ How, sir! are you in earnest then my lord?

    _Bas._ Ay, noble Titus, and resolved withal
    To do myself this reason and this right.

    _Marc._ 'Suum cuique' is our Roman justice:[4021]                280
    This prince in justice seizeth but his own.

    _Luc._ And that he will, and shall, if Lucius live.

    _Tit._ Traitors, avaunt! Where is the emperor's guard?
    Treason, my lord! Lavinia is surprised!

    _Sat._ Surprised! by whom?

    _Bas._                     By him that justly may                285
    Bear his betroth'd from all the world away.

                      [_Exeunt Bassianus and Marcus with Lavinia._[4022]

    _Mut._ Brothers, help to convey her hence away,[4023]
    And with my sword I'll keep this door safe.

                           [_Exeunt Lucius, Quintus, and Martius._[4024]

    _Tit._ Follow, my lord, and I'll soon bring her back.

    _Mut._ My lord, you pass not here.[4025]

    _Tit._                             What, villain boy![4026]      290
    Barr'st me my way in Rome?                 [_Stabbing Mutius._[4026]

    _Mut._                     Help, Lucius, help!              [_Dies._

                       [_During the fray, Saturninus, Tamora, Demetrius,
                           Chiron and Aaron go out, and re-enter above._

                        _Re-enter_ LUCIUS.[4027]

    _Luc._ My lord, you are unjust; and, more than so,
    In wrongful quarrel you have slain your son.

    _Tit._ Nor thou, nor he, are any sons of mine;
    My sons would never so dishonour me:                             295
    Traitor, restore Lavinia to the emperor.

    _Luc._ Dead, if you will; but not to be his wife,
    That is another's lawful promised love.               [_Exit._[4028]

    _Sat._ No, Titus, no; the emperor needs her not,
    Nor her, nor thee, nor any of thy stock:[4029]                   300
    I'll trust by leisure him that mocks me once;
    Thee never, nor thy traitorous haughty sons,
    Confederates all thus to dishonour me.
    Was none in Rome to make a stale[4030][4031]
    But Saturnine? Full well, Andronicus,[4031]                      305
    Agree these deeds with that proud brag of thine,
    That saidst, I begg'd the empire at thy hands.

    _Tit._ O monstrous! what reproachful words are these?

    _Sat._ But go thy ways; go, give that changing piece
    To him that flourish'd for her with his sword:                   310
    A valiant son-in-law thou shalt enjoy;
    One fit to bandy with thy lawless sons,
    To ruffle in the commonwealth of Rome.

    _Tit._ These words are razors to my wounded heart.

    _Sat._ And therefore, lovely Tamora, queen of Goths,             315
    That, like the stately Phœbe 'mongst her nymphs,[4032]
    Dost overshine the gallant'st dames of Rome,
    If thou be pleased with this my sudden choice,
    Behold, I choose thee, Tamora, for my bride,
    And will create thee empress of Rome.[4033]                      320
    Speak, Queen of Goths, dost thou applaud my choice?
    And here I swear by all the Roman gods,
    Sith priest and holy water are so near
    And tapers burn so bright and every thing
    In readiness for Hymenæus stand,[4034]                           325
    I will not re-salute the streets of Rome,
    Or climb my palace, till from forth this place
    I lead espoused my bride along with me.

    _Tam._ And here, in sight of heaven, to Rome I swear,
    If Saturnine advance the Queen of Goths,                         330
    She will a handmaid be to his desires,
    A loving nurse, a mother to his youth.

    _Sat._ Ascend, fair queen, Pantheon. Lords, accompany[4035]
    Your noble emperor and his lovely bride,
    Sent by the heavens for Prince Saturnine,                        335
    Whose wisdom hath her fortune conquered:
    There shall we consummate our spousal rites.

                                         [_Exeunt all but Titus._[4036]

    _Tit._ I am not bid to wait upon this bride.[4037]
    Titus, when wert thou wont to walk alone,
    Dishonour'd thus and challenged of wrongs?                       340

        _Re-enter_ MARCUS, LUCIUS, QUINTUS, _and_ MARTIUS.[4038]

    _Marc._ O Titus, see, O, see what thou hast done!
    In a bad quarrel slain a virtuous son.

    _Tit._ No, foolish tribune, no; no son of mine,
    Nor thou, nor these, confederates in the deed
    That hath dishonour'd all our family;[4039]                      345
    Unworthy brother, and unworthy sons!

    _Luc._ But let us give him burial, as becomes;
    Give Mutius burial with our brethren.

    _Tit._ Traitors, away! he rests not in this tomb:
    This monument five hundred years hath stood,[4040]               350
    Which I have sumptuously re-edified:
    Here none but soldiers and Rome's servitors
    Repose in fame; none basely slain in brawls:
    Bury him where you can, he comes not here.

    _Marc._ My lord, this is impiety in you:                         355
    My nephew Mutius' deeds do plead for him;[4041]
    He must be buried with his brethren.

    _Quin._} And shall, or him we will accompany.[4042]
    _Mart._}

    _Tit._ And shall! what villain was it spake that word?

    _Quin._ He that would vouch it in any place but here.[4043]      360

    _Tit._ What, would you bury him in my despite?

    _Marc._ No, noble Titus; but entreat of thee
    To pardon Mutius and to bury him.

    _Tit._ Marcus, even thou hast struck upon my crest[4044]
    And with these boys mine honour thou hast wounded:               365
    My foes I do repute you every one;
    So trouble me no more, but get you gone.

    _Mart._ He is not with himself; let us withdraw.[4045]

    _Quin._ Not I, till Mutius' bones be buried.[4046]

                            [_Marcus and the sons of Titus kneel._[4047]

    _Marc._ Brother, for in that name doth nature plead,--           370

    _Quin._ Father, and in that name doth nature speak,--[4046]

    _Tit._ Speak thou no more, if all the rest will speed.[4048]

    _Marc._ Renowned Titus, more than half my soul,--[4049]

    _Luc._ Dear father, soul and substance of us all,--

    _Marc._ Suffer thy brother Marcus to inter                       375
    His noble nephew here in virtue's nest,
    That died in honour and Lavinia's cause.
    Thou art a Roman; be not barbarous:
    The Greeks upon advice did bury Ajax[4050]
    That slew himself; and wise Laertes' son[4051]                   380
    Did graciously plead for his funerals:
    Let not young Mutius then, that was thy joy,
    Be barr'd his entrance here.

    _Tit._ Rise, Marcus, rise:
    The dismall'st day is this that e'er I saw,
    To be dishonour'd by my sons in Rome![4039]                      385
    Well, bury him, and bury me the next.

                                   [_Mutius is put into the tomb._[4052]

    _Luc._ There lie thy bones, sweet Mutius, with thy friends,
    Till we with trophies do adorn thy tomb.

    _All._ [_Kneeling_] No man shed tears for noble Mutius;[4053][4054]
    He lives in fame that died in virtue's cause.[4054][4055]        390

    _Marc._ My lord, to step out of these dreary dumps,[4056]
    How comes it that the subtle Queen of Goths
    Is of a sudden thus advanced in Rome?

    _Tit._ I know not, Marcus; but I know it is,
    Whether by device or no, the heavens can tell:[4057]             395
    Is she not then beholding to the man[4058]
    That brought her for this high good turn so far?
    Yes, and will nobly him remunerate.[4059]

    _Flourish. Re-enter, from one side_, SATURNINUS _attended_,
        TAMORA, DEMETRIUS, CHIRON, _and_ AARON; _from the other_,
        BASSIANUS, LAVINIA, _with others_.[4060]

    _Sat._ So, Bassianus, you have play'd your prize:[4061]
    God give you joy, sir, of your gallant bride!                    400

    _Bas._ And you of yours, my lord! I say no more,
    Nor wish no less; and so I take my leave.

    _Sat._ Traitor, if Rome have law, or we have power,
    Thou and thy faction shall repent this rape.

    _Bas._ Rape, call you it, my lord, to seize my own,              405
    My true-betrothed love, and now my wife?[4062]
    But let the laws of Rome determine all;
    Meanwhile I am possess'd of that is mine.

    _Sat._ 'Tis good, sir: you are very short with us;
    But, if we live, we'll be as sharp with you.                     410

    _Bas._ My lord, what I have done, as best I may,
    Answer I must, and shall do with my life.
    Only thus much I give your grace to know:
    By all the duties that I owe to Rome,[4063]
    This noble gentleman, Lord Titus here,                           415
    Is in opinion and in honour wrong'd;
    That, in the rescue of Lavinia,
    With his own hand did slay his youngest son,
    In zeal to you and highly moved to wrath
    To be controll'd in that he frankly gave:                        420
    Receive him then to favour, Saturnine,
    That hath express'd himself in all his deeds
    A father and a friend to thee and Rome.

    _Tit._ Prince Bassianus, leave to plead my deeds:
    'Tis thou and those that have dishonour'd me.[4064]              425
    Rome and the righteous heavens be my judge,
    How I have loved and honour'd Saturnine![4065]

    _Tam._ My worthy lord, if ever Tamora
    Were gracious in those princely eyes of thine,
    Then hear me speak indifferently for all;                        430
    And at my suit, sweet, pardon what is past.

    _Sat._ What, madam! be dishonour'd openly,[4039]
    And basely put it up without revenge?[4066]

    _Tam._ Not so, my lord; the gods of Rome forfend[4067]
    I should be author to dishonour you!                             435
    But on mine honour dare I undertake[4068]
    For good Lord Titus' innocence in all;[4069]
    Whose fury not dissembled speaks his griefs:
    Then, at my suit, look graciously on him;
    Lose not so noble a friend on vain suppose,                      440
    Nor with sour looks afflict his gentle heart.
    [_Aside to Sat._] My lord, be ruled by me, be won at last;[4070]
    Dissemble all your griefs and discontents:
    You are but newly planted in your throne;
    Lest then the people, and patricians too,                        445
    Upon a just survey, take Titus' part,
    And so supplant you for ingratitude,[4071]
    Which Rome reputes to be a heinous sin,[4072]
    Yield at entreats, and then let me alone:
    I'll find a day to massacre them all,                            450
    And raze their faction and their family,[4073]
    The cruel father and his traitorous sons,
    To whom I sued for my dear son's life;
    And make them know what 'tis to let a queen
    Kneel in the streets and beg for grace in vain.--                455
    Come, come, sweet emperor; come, Andronicus;[4074]
    Take up this good old man, and cheer the heart
    That dies in tempest of thy angry frown.

    _Sat._ Rise, Titus, rise; my empress hath prevail'd.[4075][4076]

    _Tit._ I thank your majesty, and her, my lord:[4076]             460
    These words, these looks, infuse new life in me.[4076]

    _Tam._ Titus, I am incorporate in Rome,
    A Roman now adopted happily,
    And must advise the emperor for his good.
    This day all quarrels die, Andronicus.                           465
    And let it be mine honour, good my lord,[4077]
    That I have reconciled your friends and you.
    For you, Prince Bassianus, I have pass'd
    My word and promise to the emperor,
    That you will be more mild and tractable.                        470
    And fear not, lords, and you, Lavinia;[4078]
    By my advice, all humbled on your knees,[4079]
    You shall ask pardon of his majesty.

    _Luc._ We do; and vow to heaven, and to his highness,[4080]
    That what we did was mildly as we might,                         475
    Tendering our sister's honour and our own.

    _Marc._ That, on mine honour, here I do protest.

    _Sat._ Away, and talk not; trouble us no more.[4075]

    _Tam._ Nay, nay, sweet emperor, we must all be friends:[4081]
    The tribune and his nephews kneel for grace;                     480
    I will not be denied: sweet heart, look back.

    _Sat._ Marcus, for thy sake and thy brother's here,[4075][4082]
    And at my lovely Tamora's entreats,
    I do remit these young men's heinous faults:
    Stand up.[4083]                                                  485
    Lavinia, though you left me like a churl,
    I found a friend; and sure as death I swore[4084]
    I would not part a bachelor from the priest.
    Come, if the emperor's court can feast two brides,
    You are my guest, Lavinia, and your friends.                     490
    This day shall be a love-day, Tamora.

    _Tit._ To-morrow, an it please your majesty[4085]
    To hunt the panther and the hart with me,[4086]
    With horn and hound we'll give your grace bonjour.[4087]

    _Sat._ Be it so, Titus, and gramercy too.        495

ACT II.


SCENE I. _Rome. Before the palace._

                          _Enter_ AARON.[4089]

    _Aar._ Now climbeth Tamora Olympus' top,
    Safe out of fortune's shot, and sits aloft,
    Secure of thunder's crack or lightning flash,
    Advanced above pale envy's threatening reach.[4090]
    As when the golden sun salutes the morn,                           5
    And, having gilt the ocean with his beams,
    Gallops the zodiac in his glistering coach,
    And overlooks the highest-peering hills;[4091]
    So Tamora:[4092]
    Upon her wit doth earthly honour wait,[4093]                      10
    And virtue stoops and trembles at her frown.
    Then, Aaron, arm thy heart, and fit thy thoughts,[4094]
    To mount aloft with thy imperial mistress,[4095]
    And mount her pitch, whom thou in triumph long
    Hast prisoner held, fetter'd in amorous chains,                   15
    And faster bound to Aaron's charming eyes
    Than is Prometheus tied to Caucasus.[4096]
    Away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts![4097]
    I will be bright, and shine in pearl and gold,
    To wait upon this new-made empress.[4098]                         20
    To wait, said I? to wanton with this queen,[4099]
    This goddess, this Semiramis, this nymph,[4100]
    This siren, that will charm Rome's Saturnine,
    And see his shipwreck and his commonweal's.
    Holloa! what storm is this?                                       25

            _Enter_ DEMETRIUS _and_ CHIRON, _braving_.[4101]

    _Dem._ Chiron, thy years want wit, thy wit wants edge,[4102]
    And manners, to intrude where I am graced,
    And may, for aught thou know'st, affected be.[4103]

    _Chi._ Demetrius, thou dost over-ween in all,
    And so in this, to bear me down with braves.                      30
    'Tis not the difference of a year or two
    Makes me less gracious, or thee more fortunate:[4104]
    I am as able and as fit as thou
    To serve, and to deserve my mistress' grace;
    And that my sword upon thee shall approve,                        35
    And plead my passions for Lavinia's love.[4105]

    _Aar._ [_Aside_] Clubs, clubs! these lovers will not keep
                the peace.[4106][4107]

    _Dem._ Why, boy, although our mother, unadvised,
    Gave you a dancing-rapier by your side,[4108]
    Are you so desperate grown, to threat your friends?[4109]         40
    Go to; have your lath glued within your sheath
    Till you know better how to handle it.

    _Chi._ Meanwhile, sir, with the little skill I have,
    Full well shalt thou perceive how much I dare.

    _Dem._ Ay, boy, grow ye so brave?                      [_They draw._

    _Aar._         [_Coming forward_] Why, how now, lords![4110]      45
    So near the emperor's palace dare you draw,
    And maintain such a quarrel openly?
    Full well I wot the ground of all this grudge:[4111]
    I would not for a million of gold
    The cause were known to them it most concerns;                    50
    Nor would your noble mother for much more
    Be so dishonour'd in the court of Rome.[4112]
    For shame, put up.

    _Dem._             Not I, till I have sheathed[4113]
    My rapier in his bosom, and withal
    Thrust those reproachful speeches down his throat[4114]           55
    That he hath breathed in my dishonour here.

    _Chi._ For that I am prepared and full resolved.[4115]
    Foul-spoken coward! that thunder'st with thy tongue[4116]
    And with thy weapon nothing darest perform.[4117]

    _Aar._ Away, I say![4106]                                         60
    Now, by the gods that warlike Goths adore,[4118]
    This petty brabble will undo us all.[4119]
    Why, lords, and think you not how dangerous[4120]
    It is to jet upon a prince's right?[4121]
    What, is Lavinia then become so loose,                            65
    Or Bassianus so degenerate,
    That for her love such quarrels may be broach'd
    Without controlment, justice, or revenge?[4122]
    Young lords, beware! an should the empress know[4123]
    This discord's ground, the music would not please.[4124]          70

    _Chi._ I care not, I, knew she and all the world:
    I love Lavinia more than all the world.

    _Dem._ Youngling, learn thou to make some meaner choice:[4125]
    Lavinia is thine elder brother's hope.

    _Aar._ Why, are ye mad? or know ye not, in Rome[4106][4126]       75
    How furious and impatient they be,
    And cannot brook competitors in love?
    I tell you, lords, you do but plot your deaths
    By this device.[4127]

    _Chi._          Aaron, a thousand deaths[4128]
    Would I propose to achieve her whom I love.[4128][4129]           80

    _Aar._ To achieve her! how?

    _Dem._                      Why makest thou it so strange?[4130]
    She is a woman, therefore may be woo'd;
    She is a woman, therefore may be won;
    She is Lavinia, therefore must be loved.
    What, man! more water glideth by the mill                         85
    Than wots the miller of; and easy it is
    Of a cut loaf to steal a shive, we know:
    Though Bassianus be the emperor's brother,
    Better than he have worn Vulcan's badge.[4131]

    _Aar._ [_Aside_] Ay, and as good as Saturninus may.[4106][4132]   90

    _Dem._ Then why should he despair that knows to court it
    With words, fair looks, and liberality?
    What, hast not thou full often struck a doe,[4133]
    And borne her cleanly by the keeper's nose?

    _Aar._ Why, then, it seems, some certain snatch or so[4106]       95
    Would serve your turns.

    _Chi._                  Ay, so the turn were served.

    _Dem._ Aaron, thou hast hit it.

    _Aar._                          Would you had hit it too![4106]
    Then should not we be tired with this ado.
    Why, hark ye, hark ye! and are you such fools
    To square for this? would it offend you, then,[4134]             100
    That both should speed?[4135]

    _Chi._ Faith, not me.

    _Dem._                Nor me, so I were one.[4136]

    _Aar._ For shame, be friends, and join for that you jar:
    'Tis policy and stratagem must do
    That you affect; and so must you resolve,                        105
    That what you cannot as you would achieve,
    You must perforce accomplish as you may.
    Take this of me: Lucrece was not more chaste
    Than this Lavinia, Bassianus' love.[4137]
    A speedier course than lingering languishment[4138]              110
    Must we pursue, and I have found the path.[4139]
    My lords, a solemn hunting is in hand;
    There will the lovely Roman ladies troop:
    The forest walks are wide and spacious;
    And many unfrequented plots there are                            115
    Fitted by kind for rape and villany:
    Single you thither then this dainty doe,
    And strike her home by force, if not by words:
    This way, or not at all, stand you in hope.
    Come, come, our empress, with her sacred wit[4140]               120
    To villany and vengeance consecrate,
    Will we acquaint with all that we intend;[4141]
    And she shall file our engines with advice,[4142]
    That will not suffer you to square yourselves,
    But to your wishes' height advance you both.                     125
    The emperor's court is like the house of Fame,
    The palace full of tongues, of eyes and ears:[4143]
    The woods are ruthless, dreadful, deaf and dull;[4144]
    There speak, and strike, brave boys, and take your turns;
    There serve your lust, shadow'd from heaven's eye,[4145]         130
    And revel in Lavinia's treasury.

    _Chi._ Thy counsel, lad, smells of no cowardice.

    _Dem._ Sit fas aut nefas, till I find the stream[4146]
    To cool this heat, a charm to calm these fits,[4147]
    Per Styga, per manes vehor.                    [_Exeunt._[4148]  135


SCENE II. _A forest near Rome. Horns and cry of hounds heard._

     _Enter_ TITUS ANDRONICUS, _with_ Hunters, &c., MARCUS, LUCIUS,
                     QUINTUS, _and_ MARTIUS.[4149]

    _Tit._ The hunt is up, the morn is bright and grey,[4150]
    The fields are fragrant, and the woods are green:[4151]
    Uncouple here, and let us make a bay,
    And wake the emperor and his lovely bride,
    And rouse the prince, and ring a hunter's peal,[4152]              5
    That all the court may echo with the noise.[4153]
    Sons, let it be your charge, as it is ours,[4154]
    To attend the emperor's person carefully.[4155]
    I have been troubled in my sleep this night,
    But dawning day new comfort hath inspired.                        10

    _A cry of hounds, and horns winded in a peal. Enter_
        SATURNINUS, TAMORA, BASSIANUS, LAVINIA, DEMETRIUS, CHIRON,
        _and their_ Attendants.[4156]

    Many good morrows to your majesty;
    Madam, to you as many and as good:
    I promised your grace a hunter's peal.

    _Sat._ And you have rung it lustily, my lords;[4157]
    Somewhat too early for new-married ladies.                        15

    _Bas._ Lavinia, how say you?

    _Lav._                       I say, no;[4158][4159]
    I have been broad awake two hours and more.[4159][4160]

    _Sat._ Come on then; horse and chariots let us have,
    And to our sport. [_To Tamora_] Madam, now shall ye see[4161]
    Our Roman hunting.

    _Marc._            I have dogs, my lord,                          20
    Will rouse the proudest panther in the chase,
    And climb the highest promontory top.[4162]

    _Tit._ And I have horse will follow where the game
    Makes way, and run like swallows o'er the plain.[4163]

    _Dem._ Chiron, we hunt not, we, with horse nor hound,[4164]       25
    But hope to pluck a dainty doe to ground.           [_Exeunt._[4164]


SCENE III. _A lonely part of the forest._

               _Enter_ AARON, _with a bag of gold_.[4165]

    _Aar._ He that had wit would think that I had none,[4166]
    To bury so much gold under a tree,
    And never after to inherit it.
    Let him that thinks of me so abjectly
    Know that this gold must coin a stratagem,                         5
    Which, cunningly effected, will beget[4167]
    A very excellent piece of villany:
    And so repose, sweet gold, for their unrest [_Hides the gold._[4168]
    That have their alms out of the empress' chest.

                         _Enter_ TAMORA.[4169]

    _Tam._ My lovely Aaron, wherefore look'st thou sad,[4170]         10
    When every thing doth make a gleeful boast?
    The birds chant melody on every bush;
    The snake lies rolled in the cheerful sun;[4171]
    The green leaves quiver with the cooling wind,
    And make a chequer'd shadow on the ground:                        15
    Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit,
    And, whilst the babbling echo mocks the hounds,
    Replying shrilly to the well-tuned horns,
    As if a double hunt were heard at once,[4172]
    Let us sit down and mark their yellowing noise;[4173]             20
    And, after conflict such as was supposed
    The wandering prince and Dido once enjoy'd,[4174]
    When with a happy storm they were surprised,
    And curtain'd with a counsel-keeping cave,
    We may, each wreathed in the other's arms,                        25
    Our pastimes done, possess a golden slumber;
    Whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds[4175]
    Be unto us as is a nurse's song
    Of lullaby to bring her babe asleep.

    _Aar._ Madam, though Venus govern your desires,[4176]             30
    Saturn is dominator over mine:
    What signifies my deadly-standing eye,[4177]
    My silence and my cloudy melancholy,
    My fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls
    Even as an adder when she doth unroll                             35
    To do some fatal execution?[4178]
    No, madam, these are no venereal signs:
    Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand,
    Blood and revenge are hammering in my head.
    Hark, Tamora, the empress of my soul,                             40
    Which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee,
    This is the day of doom for Bassianus:
    His Philomel must lose her tongue to-day,[4179]
    Thy sons make pillage of her chastity,
    And wash their hands in Bassianus' blood.                         45
    Seest thou this letter? take it up, I pray thee,[4180]
    And give the king this fatal-plotted scroll.[4181]
    Now question me no more; we are espied;
    Here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty,
    Which dreads not yet their lives' destruction.[4182]              50

    _Tam._ Ah, my sweet Moor, sweeter to me than life![4183]

    _Aar._ No more, great empress; Bassianus comes:[4166]
    Be cross with him, and I'll go fetch thy sons
    To back thy quarrels, whatsoe'er they be.                   [_Exit._

                 _Enter_ BASSIANUS _and_ LAVINIA.[4184]

    _Bas._ Who have we here? Rome's royal empress,[4185][4186]        55
    Unfurnish'd of her well-beseeming troop?[4187]
    Or is it Dian, habited like her,
    Who hath abandoned her holy groves
    To see the general hunting in this forest?

    _Tam._ Saucy controller of my private steps![4188]                60
    Had I the power that some say Dian had,
    Thy temples should be planted presently[4189]
    With horns, as was Actæon's, and the hounds[4190]
    Should drive upon thy new-transformed limbs,[4191]
    Unmannerly intruder as thou art!                                  65

    _Lav._ Under your patience, gentle empress,[4186]
    'Tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning;
    And to be doubted that your Moor and you
    Are singled forth to try experiments:
    Jove shield your husband from his hounds to-day!                  70
    'Tis pity they should take him for a stag.

    _Bas._ Believe me, queen, your swarth Cimmerian[4192]
    Doth make your honour of his body's hue,
    Spotted, detested, and abominable.
    Why are you sequester'd from all your train,                      75
    Dismounted from your snow-white goodly steed,
    And wander'd hither to an obscure plot,
    Accompanied but with a barbarous Moor,[4193]
    If foul desire had not conducted you?

    _Lav._ And, being intercepted in your sport,[4194]                80
    Great reason that my noble lord be rated
    For sauciness. I pray you, let us hence,
    And let her joy her raven-colour'd love;[4195]
    This valley fits the purpose passing well.

    _Bas._ The king my brother shall have note of this.[4196]         85

    _Lav._ Ay, for these slips have made him noted long:[4197]
    Good king, to be so mightily abused!

    _Tam._ Why have I patience to endure all this?[4198]

                    _Enter_ DEMETRIUS _and_ CHIRON.

    _Dem._ How now, dear sovereign, and our gracious mother![4199]
    Why doth your highness look so pale and wan?[4200]                90

    _Tam._ Have I not reason, think you, to look pale?
    These two have ticed me hither to this place:
    A barren detested vale, you see it is;[4201]
    The trees, though summer, yet forlorn and lean,
    O'ercome with moss and baleful mistletoe:[4202]                   95
    Here never shines the sun; here nothing breeds,
    Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven:
    And when they show'd me this abhorred pit,
    They told me, here, at dead time of the night,
    A thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes,                    100
    Ten thousand swelling toads, as many urchins,
    Would make such fearful and confused cries,
    As any mortal body hearing it[4203]
    Should straight fall mad, or else die suddenly.
    No sooner had they told this hellish tale,                       105
    But straight they told me they would bind me here
    Unto the body of a dismal yew,[4204]
    And leave me to this miserable death:
    And then they call'd me foul adulteress,
    Lascivious Goth, and all the bitterest terms                     110
    That ever ear did hear to such effect:[4205]
    And, had you not by wondrous fortune come,
    This vengeance on me had they executed.
    Revenge it, as you love your mother's life,
    Or be ye not henceforth call'd my children.[4206]                115

    _Dem._ This is a witness that I am thy son. [_Stabs Bassianus._[4207]

    _Chi._ And this for me, struck home to show my strength.[4208]

                                      [_Also stabs Bassianus, who dies._

    _Lav._ Ay, come, Semiramis, nay, barbarous Tamora,[4209]
    For no name fits thy nature but thy own!

    _Tam._ Give me the poniard; you shall know, my boys,[4210]       120
    Your mother's hand shall right your mother's wrong.

    _Dem._ Stay, madam; here is more belongs to her;
    First thrash the corn, then after burn the straw:
    This minion stood upon her chastity,
    Upon her nuptial vow, her loyalty,                               125
    And with that painted hope braves your mightiness:[4211][4212]
    And shall she carry this unto her grave?[4212][4213]

    _Chi._ An if she do, I would I were an eunuch.[4214]
    Drag hence her husband to some secret hole,
    And make his dead trunk pillow to our lust.[4215]                130

    _Tam._ But when ye have the honey ye desire,[4216]
    Let not this wasp outlive, us both to sting.[4217]

    _Chi._ I warrant you, madam, we will make that sure.[4218]
    Come, mistress, now perforce we will enjoy
    That nice-preserved honesty of yours.[4219]                      135

    _Lav._ O Tamora! thou bear'st a woman's face--[4220]

    _Tam._ I will not hear her speak; away with her!

    _Lav._ Sweet lords, entreat her hear me but a word.

    _Dem._ Listen, fair madam: let it be your glory
    To see her tears, but be your heart to them                      140
    As unrelenting flint to drops of rain.[4221]

    _Lav._ When did the tiger's young ones teach the dam?[4222]
    O, do not learn her wrath; she taught it thee;[4223]
    The milk thou suck'dst from her did turn to marble;[4224]
    Even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny.[4225]                   145
    Yet every mother breeds not sons alike:
    [_To Chiron_] Do thou entreat her show a woman pity.[4226]

    _Chi._ What, wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard?[4227]

    _Lav._ 'Tis true; the raven doth not hatch a lark:[4227][4228]
    Yet have I heard,--O, could I find it now!--                     150
    The lion, moved with pity, did endure
    To have his princely paws pared all away:[4229]
    Some say that ravens foster forlorn children,
    The whilst their own birds famish in their nests:
    O, be to me, though thy hard heart say no,                       155
    Nothing so kind, but something pitiful!

    _Tam._ I know not what it means: away with her!

    _Lav._ O, let me teach thee! for my father's sake,
    That gave thee life, when well he might have slain thee,
    Be not obdurate, open thy deaf ears.[4230]                       160

    _Tam._ Hadst thou in person ne'er offended me,
    Even for his sake am I pitiless.[4231]
    Remember, boys, I pour'd forth tears in vain,
    To save your brother from the sacrifice;
    But fierce Andronicus would not relent:                          165
    Therefore, away with her, and use her as you will;[4232]
    The worse to her, the better loved of me.

    _Lav._ O Tamora, be call'd a gentle queen,[4233]
    And with thine own hands kill me in this place!
    For 'tis not life that I have begg'd so long;                    170
    Poor I was slain when Bassianus died.[4234]

    _Tam._ What begg'st thou then? fond woman, let me go.[4235]

    _Lav._ Tis present death I beg; and one thing more
    That womanhood denies my tongue to tell:
    O, keep me from their worse than killing lust,                   175
    And tumble me into some loathsome pit,
    Where never man's eye may behold my body:
    Do this, and be a charitable murderer.

    _Tam._ So should I rob my sweet sons of their fee:
    No, let them satisfy their lust on thee.                         180

    _Dem._ Away! for thou hast stay'd us here too long.[4236]

    _Lav._ No grace? no womanhood? Ah, beastly creature![4236][4237]
    The blot and enemy to our general name![4238]
    Confusion fall--[4239]

    _Chi._ Nay, then I'll stop your mouth. Bring thou her husband:[4240]  185
    This is the hole where Aaron bid us hide him.

                      [_Demetrius throws the body of Bassianus into the
                        pit; then exeunt Demetrius and Chiron, dragging
                                                    off Lavinia._[4241]

    _Tam._ Farewell, my sons: see that you make her sure.
    Ne'er let my heart know merry cheer indeed,
    Till all the Andronici be made away.[4242]
    Now will I hence to seek my lovely Moor,                         190
    And let my spleenful sons this trull deflower.              [_Exit._

         _Re-enter_ AARON, _with_ QUINTUS _and_ MARTIUS.[4243]

    _Aar._ Come on, my lords, the better foot before:[4244]
    Straight will I bring you to the loathsome pit[4245]
    Where I espied the panther fast asleep.

    _Quin._ My sight is very dull, whate'er it bodes.                195

    _Mart._ And mine, I promise you; were it not for shame,[4246]
    Well could I leave our sport to sleep awhile.

                                           [_Falls into the pit._[4247]

    _Quin._ What, art thou fall'n? What subtle hole is this,[4248]
    Whose mouth is cover'd with rude-growing briers,[4249]
    Upon whose leaves are drops of new-shed blood                    200
    As fresh as morning dew distill'd on flowers?[4250]
    A very fatal place it seems to me.
    Speak, brother, hast thou hurt thee with the fall?

    _Mart._ O brother, with the dismal'st object hurt[4251]
    That ever eye with sight made heart lament!                      205

    _Aar._ [_Aside_] Now will I fetch the king to find them here,[4252]
    That he thereby may have a likely guess[4253]
    How these were they that made away his brother.       [_Exit._[4254]

    _Mart._ Why dost not comfort me, and help me out[4255]
    From this unhallow'd and blood-stained hole?[4256]               210

    _Quin._ I am surprised with an uncouth fear;[4257]
    A chilling sweat o'er-runs my trembling joints;[4258]
    My heart suspects more than mine eye can see.

    _Mart._ To prove thou hast a true-divining heart,[4259]
    Aaron and thou look down into this den,[4260]                    215
    And see a fearful sight of blood and death.

    _Quin._ Aaron is gone; and my compassionate heart[4261]
    Will not permit mine eyes once to behold
    The thing whereat it trembles by surmise:
    O, tell me how it is; for ne'er till now[4262]                   220
    Was I a child to fear I know not what.

    _Mart._ Lord Bassianus lies embrewed here,
    All on a heap, like to a slaughter'd lamb,[4263]
    In this detested, dark, blood-drinking pit.

    _Quin._ If it be dark, how dost thou know 'tis he?[4264]         225

    _Mart._ Upon his bloody finger he doth wear
    A precious ring, that lightens all the hole,[4265]
    Which, like a taper in some monument,
    Doth shine upon the dead man's earthy cheeks,[4266]
    And shows the ragged entrails of the pit:[4267]                  230
    So pale did shine the moon on Pyramus
    When he by night lay bathed in maiden blood.
    0 brother, help me with thy fainting hand--
    If fear hath made thee faint, as me it hath--[4268]
    Out of this fell devouring receptacle,[4269]                     235
    As hateful as Cocytus' misty mouth.[4270]

    _Quin._ Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out;
    Or, wanting strength to do thee so much good,
    I may be pluck'd into the swallowing womb
    Of this deep pit, poor Bassianus' grave.                         240
    I have no strength to pluck thee to the brink.

    _Mart._ Nor I no strength to climb without thy help.[4271]

    _Quin._ Thy hand once more; I will not loose again,[4272]
    Till thou art here aloft, or I below:
    Thou canst not come to me: I come to thee.         [_Falls in._  245

                 _Enter_ SATURNINUS _with_ AARON.[4273]

    _Sat._ Along with me: I'll see what hole is here,[4274]
    And what he is that now is leap'd into it.[4275]
    Say, who art thou that lately didst descend
    Into this gaping hollow of the earth?[4276]

    _Mart._ The unhappy son of old Andronicus;                       250
    Brought hither in a most unlucky hour,
    To find thy brother Bassianus dead.

    _Sat._ My brother dead! I know thou dost but jest:
    He and his lady both are at the lodge
    Upon the north side of this pleasant chase;                      255
    'Tis not an hour since I left them there.[4277]

    _Mart._ We know not where you left them all alive;[4278]
    But, out, alas! here have we found him dead.

     _Re-enter_ TAMORA, _with_ Attendants; TITUS ANDRONICUS, _and_
                             LUCIUS.[4279]

    _Tam._ Where is my lord the king?

    _Sat._ Here, Tamora; though grieved with killing grief.[4280]    260

    _Tam._ Where is thy brother Bassianus?

    _Sat._ Now to the bottom dost thou search my wound:
    Poor Bassianus here lies murdered.

    _Tam._ [_Giving a letter_] Then all too late I bring this fatal writ,[4281]
    The complot of this timeless tragedy;                            265
    And wonder greatly that man's face can fold
    In pleasing smiles such murderous tyranny.

    _Sat._ [_Reads_] 'An if we miss to meet him handsomely--[4282]
    Sweet huntsman, Bassianus 'tis we mean--
    Do thou so much as dig the grave for him:                        270
    Thou know'st our meaning. Look for thy reward[4283]
    Among the nettles at the elder-tree
    Which overshades the mouth of that same pit
    Where we decreed to bury Bassianus.
    Do this and purchase us thy lasting friends.'                    275
    O Tamora! was ever heard the like?[4284]
    This is the pit, and this the elder-tree.
    Look, sirs, if you can find the huntsman out
    That should have murder'd Bassianus here.[4285]

    _Aar._ My gracious lord, here is the bag of gold.[4286]          280

    _Sat._ [_To Titus_] Two of thy whelps, fell curs of bloody kind,[4287]
    Have here bereft my brother of his life.
    Sirs, drag them from the pit unto the prison:
    There let them bide until we have devised
    Some never-heard-of torturing pain for them.[4288]               285

    _Tam._ What, are they in this pit? O wondrous thing![4289]
    How easily murder is discovered!

    _Tit._ High emperor, upon my feeble knee
    I beg this boon, with tears not lightly shed,
    That this fell fault of my accursed sons,                        290
    Accursed, if the fault be proved in them--[4290]

    _Sat._ If it be proved! you see it is apparent.
    Who found this letter? Tamora, was it you?

    _Tam._ Andronicus himself did take it up.

    _Tit._ I did, my lord: yet let me be their bail;[4291]           295
    For, by my fathers' reverend tomb, I vow[4292]
    They shall be ready at your highness' will
    To answer their suspicion with their lives.[4293]

    _Sat._ Thou shalt not bail them: see thou follow me.
    Some bring the murder'd body, some the murderers:[4294]          300
    Let them not speak a word; the guilt is plain;[4295]
    For, by my soul, were there worse end than death,
    That end upon them should be executed.[4296]

    _Tam._ Andronicus, I will entreat the king:
    Fear not thy sons; they shall do well enough.[4297]              305

    _Tit._ Come, Lucius, come; stay not to talk with them.

                                                        [_Exeunt._[4298]


SCENE IV. _Another part of the forest._

  _Enter_ DEMETRIUS _and_ CHIRON, _with_ LAVINIA, _ravished; her hands
                cut off, and her tongue cut out_.[4299]

    _Dem._ So, now go tell, an if thy tongue can speak,[4300]
    Who 'twas that cut thy tongue and ravish'd thee.[4301]

    _Chi._ Write down thy mind, bewray thy meaning so,
    An if thy stumps will let thee play the scribe.[4302]

    _Dem._ See, how with signs and tokens she can scrowl.[4303]        5

    _Chi._ Go home, call for sweet water, wash thy hands.[4304]

    _Dem._ She hath no tongue to call, nor hands to wash;
    And so let's leave her to her silent walks.

    _Chi._ An 'twere my case, I should go hang myself.[4305]

    _Dem._ If thou hadst hands to help thee knit the cord.            10

                                         [_Exeunt Demetrius and Chiron._

      _Horns winded, within. Enter_ MARCUS, _from hunting_.[4306]

    _Mar._ Who is this? my niece, that flies away so fast![4307]
    Cousin, a word; where is your husband?[4308]
    If I do dream, would all my wealth would wake me!
    If I do wake, some planet strike me down,
    That I may slumber in eternal sleep!                              15
    Speak, gentle niece, what stern ungentle hands[4309]
    Have lopp'd and hew'd and made thy body bare[4309]
    Of her two branches, those sweet ornaments,
    Whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in,
    And might not gain so great a happiness                           20
    As have thy love? Why dost not speak to me?[4310]
    Alas, a crimson river of warm blood,
    Like to a bubbling fountain stirr'd with wind,
    Doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips,[4311]
    Coming and going with thy honey breath.                           25
    But, sure, some Tereus hath deflowered thee,
    And, lest thou shouldst detect him, cut thy tongue.[4312]
    Ah, now thou turn'st away thy face for shame!
    And, notwithstanding all this loss of blood,
    As from a conduit with three issuing spouts,[4313]                30
    Yet do thy cheeks look red as Titan's face
    Blushing to be encounter'd with a cloud.
    Shall I speak for thee? shall I say 'tis so?[4314]
    O, that I knew thy heart; and knew the beast,[4315]
    That I might rail at him, to ease my mind!                        35
    Sorrow concealed, like an oven stopp'd,
    Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is.
    Fair Philomel, why she but lost her tongue,[4316]
    And in a tedious sampler sew'd her mind:[4317]
    But, lovely niece, that mean is cut from thee;                    40
    A craftier Tereus, cousin, hast thou met,[4318]
    And he hath cut those pretty fingers off,
    That could have better sew'd than Philomel.[4319]
    O, had the monster seen those lily hands
    Tremble, like aspen-leaves, upon a lute,                          45
    And make the silken strings delight to kiss them,
    He would not then have touch'd them for his life!
    Or, had he heard the heavenly harmony
    Which that sweet tongue hath made,[4320]
    He would have dropp'd his knife, and fell asleep[4321]            50
    As Cerberus at the Thracian poet's feet.
    Come, let us go and make thy father blind;
    For such a sight will blind a father's eye:
    One hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads;
    What will whole months of tears thy father's eyes?                55
    Do not draw back, for we will mourn with thee:
    O, could our mourning ease thy misery!              [_Exeunt._[4322]

    _Tit._ Hear me, grave fathers! noble tribunes, stay!
    For pity of mine age, whose youth was spent
    In dangerous wars, whilst you securely slept;
    For all my blood in Rome's great quarrel shed;
    For all the frosty nights that I have watch'd;                     5
    And for these bitter tears, which now you see[4324]
    Filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks;
    Be pitiful to my condemned sons,
    Whose souls are not corrupted as 'tis thought.[4325]
    For two and twenty sons I never wept,                             10

    My heart's deep languor and my soul's sad tears:[4328]
    Let my tears stanch the earth's dry appetite;[4329]
    My sons' sweet blood will make it shame and blush.                15
    O earth, I will befriend thee more with rain,[4330]
    That shall distil from these two ancient urns,[4331]
    Than youthful April shall with all his showers:[4332][4333]
    In summer's drought I'll drop upon thee still;[4333]
    In winter with warm tears I'll melt the snow,                     20
    And keep eternal spring-time on thy face,
    So thou refuse to drink my dear sons' blood.

             _Enter_ LUCIUS, _with his weapon drawn_.[4334]

    O reverend tribunes! O gentle, aged men![4335]
    Unbind my sons, reverse the doom of death;
    And let me say, that never wept before,                           25
    My tears are now prevailing orators.

    _Luc._ O noble father, you lament in vain:
    The tribunes hear you not; no man is by;[4336]
    And you recount your sorrows to a stone.

    _Tit._ Ah, Lucius, for thy brothers let me plead.                 30
    Grave tribunes, once more I entreat of you,--[4337]

    _Luc._ My gracious lord, no tribune hears you speak.

    _Tit._ Why, 'tis no matter, man: if they did hear,[4338]
    They would not mark me; or if they did mark,[4339]
    They would not pity me; yet plead I must,[4339]                   35
    And bootless unto them....[4339]
    Therefore I tell my sorrows to the stones;[4340]
    Who, though they cannot answer my distress,
    Yet in some sort they are better than the tribunes,[4341]
    For that they will not intercept my tale:[4342]                   40
    When I do weep, they humbly at my feet
    Receive my tears, and seem to weep with me;
    And, were they but attired in grave weeds,
    Rome could afford no tribune like to these.
    A stone is soft as wax, tribunes more hard than stones;[4343]     45
    A stone is silent and offendeth not,
    And tribunes with their tongues doom men to death.   [_Rises._[4344]
    But wherefore stand'st thou with thy weapon drawn?[4345]

    _Luc._ To rescue my two brothers from their death:
    For which attempt the judges have pronounced[4346]                50
    My everlasting doom of banishment.

    _Tit._ O happy man! they have befriended thee.
    Why, foolish Lucius, dost thou not perceive
    That Rome is but a wilderness of tigers?
    Tigers must prey, and Rome affords no prey[4347]                  55
    But me and mine: how happy art thou then,
    From these devourers to be banished!
    But who comes with our brother Marcus here?

                     _Enter_ MARCUS _and_ LAVINIA.

    _Marc._ Titus, prepare thy aged eyes to weep;[4348]
    Or, if not so, thy noble heart to break:                          60
    I bring consuming sorrow to thine age.

    _Tit._ Will it consume me? let me see it then.

    _Marc._ This was thy daughter.

    _Tit._                         Why, Marcus, so she is.

    _Luc._ Ay me, this object kills me![4349]

    _Tit._ Faint-hearted boy, arise, and look upon her.               65
    Speak, Lavinia, what accursed hand[4350]
    Hath made thee handless in thy father's sight?[4351]
    What fool hath added water to the sea,
    Or brought a faggot to bright-burning Troy?
    My grief was at the height before thou camest;[4352]              70
    And now, like Nilus, it disdaineth bounds.
    Give me a sword, I'll chop off my hands too;[4353]
    For they have fought for Rome, and all in vain;
    And they have nursed this woe, in feeding life;[4354]
    In bootless prayer have they been held up,                        75
    And they have served me to effectless use:
    Now all the service I require of them
    Is, that the one will help to cut the other.
    'Tis well, Lavinia, that thou hast no hands;
    For hands to do Rome service is but vain.[4355]                   80

    _Luc._ Speak, gentle sister, who hath martyr'd thee?

    _Marc._ O, that delightful engine of her thoughts,
    That blabb'd them with such pleasing eloquence,
    Is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage,
    Where, like a sweet melodious bird, it sung                       85
    Sweet varied notes, enchanting every ear![4356]

    _Luc._ O, say thou for her, who hath done this deed?[4357]

    _Marc._ O, thus I found her, straying in the park,
    Seeking to hide herself, as doth the deer
    That hath received some unrecuring wound.                         90

    _Tit._ It was my dear; and he that wounded her[4358]
    Hath hurt me more than had he kill'd me dead:
    For now I stand as one upon a rock,
    Environ'd with a wilderness of sea;
    Who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave,[4359]                95
    Expecting ever when some envious surge
    Will in his brinish bowels swallow him.
    This way to death my wretched sons are gone;
    Here stands my other son, a banish'd man;
    And here my brother, weeping at my woes:                         100
    But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn,
    Is dear Lavinia, dearer than my soul.
    Had I but seen thy picture in this plight,
    It would have madded me: what shall I do
    Now I behold thy lively body so?[4360]                           105
    Thou hast no hands, to wipe away thy tears;
    Nor tongue, to tell me who hath martyr'd thee:
    Thy husband he is dead; and for his death
    Thy brothers are condemn'd, and dead by this.
    Look, Marcus! ah, son Lucius, look on her!                       110
    When I did name her brothers, then fresh tears
    Stood on her cheeks, as doth the honey-dew
    Upon a gather'd lily almost wither'd.[4361]

    _Marc._ Perchance she weeps because they kill'd her husband;
    Perchance because she knows them innocent.[4362]                 115

    _Tit._ If they did kill thy husband, then be joyful,
    Because the law hath ta'en revenge on them.
    No, no, they would not do so foul a deed;
    Witness the sorrow that their sister makes.
    Gentle Lavinia, let me kiss thy lips;                            120
    Or make some sign how I may do thee ease:[4363]
    Shall thy good uncle, and thy brother Lucius,
    And thou, and I, sit round about some fountain,
    Looking all downwards, to behold our cheeks
    How they are stain'd, as meadows yet not dry[4364]               125
    With miry slime left on them by a flood?
    And in the fountain shall we gaze so long
    Till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness,
    And made a brine-pit with our bitter tears?
    Or shall we cut away our hands, like thine?                      130
    Or shall we bite our tongues, and in dumb shows
    Pass the remainder of our hateful days?
    What shall we do? let us, that have our tongues,
    Plot some device of further misery,[4365]
    To make us wonder'd at in time to come.                          135

    _Luc._ Sweet father, cease your tears; for, at your grief,
    See how my wretched sister sobs and weeps.

    _Marc._ Patience, dear niece. Good Titus, dry thine eyes.

    _Tit._ Ah, Marcus, Marcus! brother, well I wot
    Thy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine,                          140
    For thou, poor man, hast drown'd it with thine own.

    _Luc._ Ah, my Lavinia, I will wipe thy cheeks.

    _Tit._ Mark, Marcus, mark! I understand her signs:
    Had she a tongue to speak, now would she say
    That to her brother which I said to thee:                        145
    His napkin, with his true tears all bewet,[4366]
    Can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks.
    O, what a sympathy of woe is this,
    As far from help as Limbo is from bliss!

                          _Enter_ AARON.[4367]

    _Aar._ Titus Andronicus, my lord the emperor[4368][4369]         150
    Sends thee this word, that, if thou love thy sons,
    Let Marcus, Lucius, or thyself, old Titus,
    Or any one of you, chop off your hand,
    And send it to the king: he for the same
    Will send thee hither both thy sons alive;
    And that shall be the ransom for their fault.

    _Tit._ O gracious emperor! O gentle Aaron!
    Did ever raven sing so like a lark,
    That gives sweet tidings of the sun's uprise?
    With all my heart, I'll send the emperor[4370]                   160
    My hand:[4370]
    Good Aaron, wilt thou help to chop it off?

    _Luc._ Stay, father! for that noble hand of thine,
    That hath thrown down so many enemies,
    Shall not be sent: my hand will serve the turn:                  165
    My youth can better spare my blood than you;
    And therefore mine shall save my brothers' lives.

    _Marc._ Which of your hands hath not defended Rome,
    And rear'd aloft the bloody battle-axe,
    Writing destruction on the enemy's castle?[4371]                 170
    O, none of both but are of high desert:
    My hand hath been but idle; let it serve
    To ransom my two nephews from their death;
    Then have I kept it to a worthy end.

    _Aar._ Nay, come, agree whose hand shall go along,[4369]         175
    For fear they die before their pardon come.

    _Marc._ My hand shall go.

    _Luc._                    By heaven, it shall not go!

    _Tit._ Sirs, strive no more: such wither'd herbs as these[4372]
    Are meet for plucking up, and therefore mine.

    _Luc._ Sweet father, if I shall be thought thy son,              180
    Let me redeem my brothers both from death.

    _Marc._ And, for our father's sake and mother's care,
    Now let me show a brother's love to thee.

    _Tit._ Agree between you; I will spare my hand.

    _Luc._ Then I'll go fetch an axe.                                185

    _Marc._ But I will use the axe.   [_Exeunt Lucius and Marcus._[4373]

    _Tit._ Come hither, Aaron; I'll deceive them both:
    Lend me thy hand, and I will give thee mine.

    _Aar._ [_Aside_] If that be call'd deceit, I will be honest,[4374]
    And never, whilst I live, deceive men so:                        190
    But I'll deceive you in another sort,
    And that you'll say, ere half an hour pass. [_Cuts off Titus's hand._

                 _Re-enter_ LUCIUS _and_ MARCUS.[4375]

    _Tit._ Now stay your strife: what shall be is dispatch'd.[4376]
    Good Aaron, give his majesty my hand:[4377]
    Tell him it was a hand that warded him                           195
    From thousand dangers; bid him bury it;
    More hath it merited; that let it have.[4378]
    As for my sons, say I account of them[4379]
    As jewels purchased at an easy price;
    And yet dear too, because I bought mine own.                     200

    _Aar._ I go, Andronicus: and for thy hand
    Look by and by to have thy sons with thee.
    [_Aside_] Their heads, I mean. O, how this villany[4380]
    Doth fat me with the very thoughts of it![4381]
    Let fools do good, and fair men call for grace,                  205
    Aaron will have his soul black like his face.               [_Exit._

    _Tit._ O, here I lift this one hand up to heaven,[4382]
    And bow this feeble ruin to the earth:
    If any power pities wretched tears,[4383]
    To that I call! [_To Lav._] What, would thou kneel with me?[4384]  210
    Do, then, dear heart; for heaven shall hear our prayers;
    Or with our sighs we'll breathe the welkin dim,
    And stain the sun with fog, as sometime clouds
    When they do hug him in their melting bosoms.

    _Marc._ O brother, speak with possibilities,[4385]               215
    And do not break into these deep extremes.[4386]

    _Tit._ Is not my sorrow deep, having no bottom?[4387]
    Then be my passions bottomless with them.

    _Marc._ But yet let reason govern thy lament.

    _Tit._ If there were reason for these miseries,                  220
    Then into limits could I bind my woes:
    When heaven doth weep, doth not the earth o'erflow?
    If the winds rage, doth not the sea wax mad,
    Threatening the welkin with his big-swoln face?
    And wilt thou have a reason for this coil?                       225
    I am the sea; hark, how her sighs do blow![4388]
    She is the weeping welkin, I the earth:
    Then must my sea be moved with her sighs;
    Then must my earth with her continual tears
    Become a deluge, overflow'd and drown'd:[4389]                   230
    For why my bowels cannot hide her woes,[4390]
    But like a drunkard must I vomit them.
    Then give me leave; for losers will have leave
    To ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues.

           _Enter a_ Messenger, _with two heads and a hand_.

    _Mess._ Worthy Andronicus, ill art thou repaid                   235
    For that good hand thou sent'st the emperor.
    Here are the heads of thy two noble sons;
    And here's thy hand, in scorn to thee sent back,
    Thy griefs their sports, thy resolution mock'd:[4391]
    That woe is me to think upon thy woes,                           240
    More than remembrance of my father's death.                 [_Exit._

    _Marc._ Now let hot Ætna cool in Sicily,[4392]
    And be my heart an ever-burning hell!
    These miseries are more than may be borne.
    To weep with them that weep doth ease some deal,                 245
    But sorrow flouted at is double death.

    _Luc._ Ah, that this sight should make so deep a wound,
    And yet detested life not shrink thereat!
    That ever death should let life bear his name,
    Where life hath no more interest but to breathe!       250

                                         [_Lavinia kisses Titus._[4393]

    _Marc._ Alas, poor heart, that kiss is comfortless
    As frozen water to a starved snake.

    _Tit._ When will this fearful slumber have an end?

    _Marc._ Now, farewell, flattery: die, Andronicus;[4394]
    Thou dost not slumber: see, thy two sons' heads,                 255
    Thy warlike hand, thy mangled daughter here,[4395]
    Thy other banish'd son with this dear sight[4396]
    Struck pale and bloodless, and thy brother, I,[4397]
    Even like a stony image, cold and numb.
    Ah, now no more will I control thy griefs:[4398]                 260
    Rend off thy silver hair, thy other hand[4399]
    Gnawing with thy teeth; and be this dismal sight[4400]
    The closing up of our most wretched eyes:
    Now is a time to storm; why art thou still?

    _Tit._ Ha, ha, ha!                                               265

    _Marc._ Why dost thou laugh? it fits not with this hour.

    _Tit._ Why, I have not another tear to shed:
    Besides, this sorrow is an enemy,
    And would usurp upon my watery eyes
    And make them blind with tributary tears:                        270
    Then which way shall I find Revenge's cave?[4401]
    For these two heads do seem to speak to me,
    And threat me I shall never come to bliss
    Till all these mischiefs be return'd again
    Even in their throats that have committed them.                  275
    Come, let me see what task I have to do.
    You heavy people, circle me about,
    That I may turn me to each one of you,
    And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs.
    The vow is made. Come, brother, take a head;                     280
    And in this hand the other will I bear.
    Lavinia, thou shalt be employ'd in these things;[4402][4403]
    Bear thou my hand, sweet wench, between thy teeth.[4403][4404]
    As for thee, boy, go get thee from my sight;
    Thou art an exile, and thou must not stay:
    Hie to the Goths, and raise an army there:                       285
    And, if you love me, as I think you do,[4405]
    Let's kiss and part, for we have much to do.

                                         [_Exeunt all but Lucius._[4406]

    _Luc._ Farewell, Andronicus, my noble father,[4407]
    The wofull'st man that ever lived in Rome:                       290
    Farewell, proud Rome; till Lucius come again,[4408]
    He leaves his pledges dearer than his life:[4409]
    Farewell, Lavinia, my noble sister;
    O, would thou wert as thou tofore hast been!
    But now nor Lucius nor Lavinia lives                             295
    But in oblivion and hateful griefs.
    If Lucius live, he will requite your wrongs;[4410]
    And make proud Saturnine and his empress[4411]
    Beg at the gates, like Tarquin and his queen.[4412]
    Now will I to the Goths and raise a power,                       300
    To be revenged on Rome and Saturnine.                 [_Exit._[4413]


SCENE II. _A room in Titus's house. A banquet set out._

   _Enter_ TITUS, MARCUS, LAVINIA, _and young_ LUCIUS, _a_ Boy.[4414]

    _Tit._ So, so; now sit: and look you eat no more
    Than will preserve just so much strength in us
    As will revenge these bitter woes of ours.
    Marcus, unknit that sorrow-wreathen knot:
    Thy niece and I, poor creatures, want our hands,[4415]             5
    And cannot passionate our tenfold grief
    With folded arms. This poor right hand of mine
    Is left to tyrannize upon my breast;
    Who, when my heart, all mad with misery,[4416]
    Beats in this hollow prison of my flesh,                          10
    Then thus I thump it down.
    [_To Lavinia_] Thou map of woe, that thus dost talk in signs![4417]
    When thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating,[4418]
    Thou canst not strike it thus to make it still.[4419]
    Wound it with sighing, girl, kill it with groans;[4420]           15
    Or get some little knife between thy teeth,
    And just against thy heart make thou a hole;
    That all the tears that thy poor eyes let fall
    May run into that sink, and soaking in
    Drown the lamenting fool in sea-salt tears.[4421]                 20

    _Marc._ Fie, brother, fie! teach her not thus to lay
    Such violent hands upon her tender life.

    _Tit._ How now! has sorrow made thee dote already?
    Why, Marcus, no man should be mad but I.
    What violent hands can she lay on her life?                       25
    Ah, wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands;
    To bid Æneas tell the tale twice o'er,
    How Troy was burnt and he made miserable?
    O, handle not the theme, to talk of hands,[4422]
    Lest we remember still that we have none.                         30
    Fie, fie, how franticly I square my talk,
    As if we should forget we had no hands,
    If Marcus did not name the word of hands![4423]
    Come, let's fall to; and, gentle girl, eat this:
    Here is no drink. Hark, Marcus, what she says;                    35
    I can interpret all her martyr'd signs;
    She says she drinks no other drink but tears,
    Brew'd with her sorrow, mesh'd upon her cheeks:[4424]
    Speechless complainer, I will learn thy thought;[4425]
    In thy dumb action will I be as perfect                           40
    As begging hermits in their holy prayers:[4426]
    Thou shalt not sigh, nor hold thy stumps to heaven,
    Nor wink, nor nod, nor kneel, nor make a sign,
    But I of these will wrest an alphabet,[4427]
    And by still practice learn to know thy meaning.                  45

    _Boy._ Good grandsire, leave these bitter deep laments:
    Make my aunt merry with some pleasing tale.

    _Marc._ Alas, the tender boy, in passion moved,
    Doth weep to see his grandsire's heaviness.

    _Tit._ Peace, tender sapling; thou art made of tears,             50
    And tears will quickly melt thy life away.

                               [_Marcus strikes the dish with a knife._

    What dost thou strike at, Marcus, with thy knife?[4428][4429]

    _Marc._ At that that I have kill'd, my lord,--a fly.[4428][4430]

    _Tit._ Out on thee, murderer! thou kill'st my heart;[4428][4431]
    Mine eyes are cloy'd with view of tyranny:[4428][4432]            55
    A deed of death done on the innocent[4428]
    Becomes not Titus' brother: get thee gone;[4428]
    I see thou art not for my company.[4428]

    _Marc._ Alas, my lord, I have but kill'd a fly.[4428]

    _Tit._ 'But!' How, if that fly had a father and mother?[4428][4433]  60
    How would he hang his slender gilded wings,[4428]
    And buzz lamenting doings in the air![4428][4434]
    Poor harmless fly,[4428]
    That, with his pretty buzzing melody,[4428]
    Came here to make us merry! and thou hast kill'd him.[4428][4435]  65

    _Marc._ Pardon me, sir; it was a black ill-favour'd fly,[4428][4436]
    Like to the empress' Moor; therefore I kill'd him.[4428]

    _Tit._ O, O, O,[4428][4437]
    Then pardon me for reprehending thee,[4428]
    For thou hast done a charitable deed.[4428]                       70
    Give me thy knife, I will insult on him;[4428]
    Flattering myself, as if it were the Moor[4428][4438]
    Come hither purposely to poison me.[4428]
    There's for thyself, and that's for Tamora.[4428]
    Ah, sirrah![4428][4439]                                           75
    Yet, I think, we are not brought so low,[4428][4440]
    But that between us we can kill a fly[4428]
    That comes in likeness of a coal-black Moor.[4428]

    _Marc._ Alas, poor man! grief has so wrought on him,
    He takes false shadows for true substances.                       80

    _Tit._ Come, take away. Lavinia, go with me:[4441]
    I'll to thy closet; and go read with thee
    Sad stories chanced in the times of old.
    Come, boy, and go with me: thy sight is young,
    And thou shalt read when mine begin to dazzle.  [_Exeunt._[4442]  85

ACT IV.


SCENE I. _Rome. Titus's garden._

    _Enter young_ LUCIUS _and_ LAVINIA _running after him, and the
        boy flies from her, with his books under his arm. Then
        enter_ TITUS _and_ MARCUS.[4443]

    _Boy._ Help, grandsire, help! my aunt Lavinia[4444]
    Follows me every where, I know not why:
    Good uncle Marcus, see how swift she comes.
    Alas, sweet aunt, I know not what you mean.

    _Marc._ Stand by me, Lucius; do not fear thine aunt.[4445]         5

    _Tit._ She loves thee, boy, too well to do thee harm.

    _Boy._ Ay, when my father was in Rome she did.

    _Marc._ What means my niece Lavinia by these signs?

    _Tit._ Fear her not, Lucius: somewhat doth she mean:[4446]
    See, Lucius, see how much she makes of thee:[4447]                10
    Somewhither would she have thee go with her.[4448]
    Ah, boy, Cornelia never with more care[4449]
    Read to her sons than she hath read to thee[4450]
    Sweet poetry and Tully's Orator.[4451]

    _Marc._ Canst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thus?[4452]  15

    _Boy._ My lord, I know not, I, nor can I guess,
    Unless some fit or frenzy do possess her:[4453]
    For I have heard my grandsire say full oft,
    Extremity of griefs would make men mad;[4454]
    And I have read that Hecuba of Troy                               20
    Ran mad for sorrow: that made me to fear;[4455]
    Although, my lord, I know my noble aunt
    Loves me as dear as e'er my mother did,
    And would not, but in fury, fright my youth:
    Which made me down to throw my books and fly,                     25
    Causeless perhaps. But pardon me, sweet aunt:
    And, madam, if my uncle Marcus go,
    I will most willingly attend your ladyship.[4456]

    _Marc._ Lucius, I will.                [_Lavinia turns over with her
                      stumps the books which Lucius has let fall._[4457]

    _Tit._ How now, Lavinia! Marcus, what means this?                 30
    Some book there is that she desires to see.
    Which is it, girl, of these? Open them, boy.
    But thou art deeper read, and better skill'd:
    Come, and take choice of all my library,[4458]
    And so beguile thy sorrow, till the heavens                       35
    Reveal the damn'd contriver of this deed.[4459]
    Why lifts she up her arms in sequence thus?

    _Marc._ I think she means that there were more than one[4460]
    Confederate in the fact; ay, more there was;
    Or else to heaven she heaves them for revenge.[4461]              40

    _Tit._ Lucius, what book is that she tosseth so?[4462]

    _Boy._ Grandsire, 'tis Ovid's Metamorphoses:[4463]
    My mother gave it me.

    _Marc._               For love of her that's gone,
    Perhaps she cull'd it from among the rest.

    _Tit._ Soft! so busily she turns the leaves![4464]                45
    Help her:[4465]
    What would she find? Lavinia, shall I read?
    This is the tragic tale of Philomel,
    And treats of Tereus' treason and his rape;
    And rape, I fear, was root of thine annoy.                        50

    _Marc._ See, brother, see; note how she quotes the leaves.

    _Tit._ Lavinia, wert thou thus surprised, sweet girl,
    Ravish'd and wrong'd as Philomela was,
    Forced in the ruthless, vast, and gloomy woods?
    See, see![4466]                                                   55
    Ay, such a place there is, where we did hunt--[4466]
    O, had we never, never hunted there!--
    Pattern'd by that the poet here describes,
    By nature made for murders and for rapes.

    _Marc._ O, why should nature build so foul a den,                 60
    Unless the gods delight in tragedies?[4467]

    _Tit._ Give signs, sweet girl, for here are none but friends,
    What Roman lord it was durst do the deed:
    Or slunk not Saturnine, as Tarquin erst,[4468]
    That left the camp to sin in Lucrece' bed?[4469]                  65

    _Marc._ Sit down, sweet niece: brother, sit down by me.
    Apollo, Pallas, Jove, or Mercury,
    Inspire me, that I may this treason find!
    My lord, look here: look here, Lavinia:
    This sandy plot is plain; guide, if thou canst,                   70
    This after me. [_He writes his name with his staff, and
               guides it with feet and mouth._] I have writ
               my name[4470]
    Without the help of any hand at all.
    Cursed be that heart that forced us to this shift![4471]
    Write thou, good niece; and here display at last[4472]
    What God will have discovered for revenge:[4473]                  75
    Heaven guide thy pen to print thy sorrows plain,
    That we may know the traitors and the truth!

                       [_She takes the staff in her month, and guides it
                                           with her stumps, and writes._

    _Tit._ O, do ye read, my lord, what she hath writ?[4474]
    'Stuprum. Chiron. Demetrius.'

    _Marc._ What, what! the lustful sons of Tamora                    80
    Performers of this heinous, bloody deed?[4475]

    _Tit._ Magni Dominator poli,[4476]
    Tam lentus audis scelera? tam lentus vides?

    _Marc._ O, calm thee, gentle lord; although I know
    There is enough written upon this earth                           85
    To stir a mutiny in the mildest thoughts
    And arm the minds of infants to exclaims.[4477]
    My lord, kneel down with me; Lavinia, kneel;
    And kneel, sweet boy, the Roman Hector's hope;
    And swear with me, as, with the woful fere[4478]                  90
    And father of that chaste dishonour'd dame,[4479]
    Lord Junius Brutus sware for Lucrece' rape,[4480]
    That we will prosecute by good advice[4481]
    Mortal revenge upon these traitorous Goths,
    And see their blood, or die with this reproach.[4482]             95

    _Tit._ 'Tis sure enough, an you knew how.[4483]
    But if you hunt these bear-whelps, then beware:[4484][4485]
    The dam will wake; and if she wind you once,[4485][4486]
    She's with the lion deeply still in league,
    And lulls him whilst she playeth on her back,[4487]              100
    And when he sleeps will she do what she list.
    You are a young huntsman, Marcus; let alone;[4488]
    And, come, I will go get a leaf of brass,
    And with a gad of steel will write these words,
    And lay it by: the angry northern wind                           105
    Will blow these sands, like Sibyl's leaves, abroad,
    And where's your lesson then? Boy, what say you?[4489]

    _Boy._ I say, my lord, that if I were a man,
    Their mother's bed-chamber should not be safe
    For these bad bondmen to the yoke of Rome.                       110

    _Marc._ Ay, that's my boy! thy father hath full oft
    For his ungrateful country done the like.[4490]

    _Boy._ And, uncle, so will I, an if I live.[4491]

    _Tit._ Come, go with me into mine armoury;[4492]
    Lucius, I'll fit thee, and withal, my boy[4493]                  115
    Shall carry from me to the empress' sons[4493][4494]
    Presents that I intend to send them both:
    Come, come; thou'lt do thy message, wilt thou not?[4495]

    _Boy._ Ay, with my dagger in their bosoms, grandsire.[4496]

    _Tit._ No, boy, not so; I'll teach thee another course.[4497]    120
    Lavinia, come. Marcus, look to my house:
    Lucius and I'll go brave it at the court;
    Ay, marry, will we, sir; and we'll be waited on.

                       [_Exeunt Titus, Lavinia, and Young Lucius._[4498]

    _Marc._ O heavens, can you hear a good man groan,
    And not relent, or not compassion him?                           125
    Marcus, attend him in his ecstasy,
    That hath more scars of sorrow in his heart
    Than foemen's marks upon his batter'd shield,
    But yet so just that he will not revenge.[4499]
    Revenge, ye heavens, for old Andronicus!         [_Exit._[4500]  130


SCENE II. _The same. A room in the palace._

    _Enter_ AARON, CHIRON, _and_ DEMETRIUS _at one door; and at
        another door, young_ LUCIUS _and an_ Attendant, _with a
        bundle of weapons, and verses writ upon them_.[4501]

    _Chi._ Demetrius, here's the son of Lucius;
    He hath some message to deliver us.

    _Aar._ Ay, some mad message from his mad grandfather.

    _Boy._ My lords, with all the humbleness I may,
    I greet your honours from Andronicus.                              5
    [_Aside_] And pray the Roman gods confound you both![4502]

    _Dem._ Gramercy, lovely Lucius: what's the news?[4503]

    _Boy._ [_Aside_] That you are both decipher'd, that's the news,[4502][4504]
    For villains mark'd with rape.--May it please you,[4505]
    My grandsire, well advised, hath sent by me                       10
    The goodliest weapons of his armoury
    To gratify your honourable youth,
    The hope of Rome; for so he bid me say;[4506]
    And so I do, and with his gifts present
    Your lordships, that, whenever you have need,[4507]               15
    You may be armed and appointed well:
    And so I leave you both, [_Aside_] like bloody villains.[4502]

                                      [_Exeunt Boy and Attendant._[4508]

    _Dem._ What's here? A scroll, and written round about!
    Let's see:
    [_Reads_]    'Integer vitæ, scelerisque purus,                    20
                Non eget Mauri jaculis, nec arcu.'[4509]

    _Chi._ O, 'tis a verse in Horace; I know it well:
    I read it in the grammar long ago.

    _Aar._ Ay, just; a verse in Horace; right, you have it.
    [_Aside_] Now, what a thing it is to be an ass![4510]             25
    Here's no sound jest: the old man hath found their guilt,[4510][4511]
    And sends them weapons wrapp'd about with lines,[4510][4512]
    That wound, beyond their feeling, to the quick.[4510]
    But were our witty empress well afoot,[4510]
    She would applaud Andronicus' conceit:[4510]                      30
    But let her rest in her unrest awhile.--[4510]
    And now, young lords, was't not a happy star
    Led us to Rome, strangers, and more than so,
    Captives, to be advanced to this height?
    It did me good, before the palace gate                            35
    To brave the tribune in his brother's hearing.[4513]

    _Dem._ But me more good, to see so great a lord
    Basely insinuate and send us gifts.

    _Aar._ Had he not reason, Lord Demetrius?
    Did you not use his daughter very friendly?                       40

    _Dem._ I would we had a thousand Roman dames
    At such a bay, by turn to serve our lust.[4514]

    _Chi._ A charitable wish and full of love.[4515]

    _Aar._ Here lacks but your mother for to say amen.[4515][4516]

    _Chi._ And that would she for twenty thousand more.               45

    _Dem._ Come, let us go, and pray to all the gods
    For our beloved mother in her pains.

    _Aar._ [_Aside_] Pray to the devils; the gods have given
                       us over.          [_Trumpets sound within._[4517]

    _Dem._ Why do the emperor's trumpets flourish thus?

    _Chi._ Belike, for joy the emperor hath a son.                    50

    _Dem._ Soft! who comes here?

               _Enter_ Nurse, _with a blackamoor_ Child.

    _Nur._                       Good morrow, lords:[4518][4519]
    O, tell me, did you see Aaron the Moor?[4519]

    _Aar._ Well, more or less, or ne'er a whit at all,
    Here Aaron is; and what with Aaron now?

    _Nur._ O gentle Aaron, we are all undone!                         55
    Now help, or woe betide thee evermore!

    _Aar._ Why, what a caterwauling dost thou keep![4520]
    What dost thou wrap and fumble in thine arms?

    _Nur._ O, that which I would hide from heaven's eye,
    Our empress' shame and stately Rome's disgrace!                   60
    She is deliver'd, lords, she is deliver'd.[4521]

    _Aar._ To whom?[4522][4523]

    _Nur._          I mean, she is brought a-bed.[4522]

    _Aar._ Well, God give her good rest! What hath he sent her?[4522][4524]

    _Nur._ A devil.[4522]

    _Aar._          Why, then she is the devil's dam;[4522][4525]
    A joyful issue.[4522][4525]                                       65

    _Nur._ A joyless, dismal, black and sorrowful issue:
    Here is the babe, as loathsome as a toad
    Amongst the fairest breeders of our clime:[4526]
    The empress sends it thee, thy stamp, thy seal,
    And bids thee christen it with thy dagger's point.                70

    _Aar._ 'Zounds, ye whore! is black so base a hue?[4527]
    Sweet blowse, you are a beauteous blossom, sure.[4528]

    _Dem._ Villain, what hast thou done?

    _Aar._ That which thou canst not undo.[4529]

    _Chi._ Thou hast undone our mother.                               75

    _Aar._ Villain, I have done thy mother.[4530]

    _Dem._ And therein, hellish dog, thou hast undone her.[4531]
    Woe to her chance, and damn'd her loathed choice!
    Accursed the offspring of so foul a fiend!

    _Chi._ It shall not live.                                         80

    _Aar._ It shall not die.[4532]

    _Nur._ Aaron, it must; the mother wills it so.

    _Aar._ What, must it, nurse? then let no man but I
    Do execution on my flesh and blood.

    _Dem._ I'll broach the tadpole on my rapier's point:              85
    Nurse, give it me; my sword shall soon dispatch it.

    _Aar._ Sooner this sword shall plough thy bowels up.

                     [_Takes the Child from the Nurse, and draws._[4533]

    Stay, murderous villains! will you kill your brother?
    Now, by the burning tapers of the sky,
    That shone so brightly when this boy was got,                     90
    He dies upon my scimitar's sharp point[4534]
    That touches this my first-born son and heir!
    I tell you, younglings, not Enceladus,
    With all his threatening band of Typhon's brood,
    Nor great Alcides, nor the god of war,                            95
    Shall seize this prey out of his father's hands.[4535]
    What, what, ye sanguine, shallow-hearted boys![4536]
    Ye white-limed walls! ye alehouse painted signs![4537]
    Coal-black is better than another hue,
    In that it scorns to bear another hue;[4538]                     100
    For all the water in the ocean
    Can never turn the swan's black legs to white,[4539]
    Although she lave them hourly in the flood.
    Tell the empress from me, I am of age[4540]
    To keep mine own, excuse it how she can.                         105

    _Dem._ Wilt thou betray thy noble mistress thus?

    _Aar._ My mistress is my mistress, this myself,
    The vigour and the picture of my youth:
    This before all the world do I prefer;
    This maugre all the world will I keep safe,                      110
    Or some of you shall smoke for it in Rome.

    _Dem._ By this our mother is for ever shamed.

    _Chi._ Rome will despise her for this foul escape.

    _Nur._ The emperor in his rage will doom her death.

    _Chi._ I blush to think upon this ignomy.[4541]                  115

    _Aar._ Why, there's the privilege your beauty bears:
    Fie, treacherous hue, that will betray with blushing
    The close enacts and counsels of the heart![4542]
    Here's a young lad framed of another leer:
    Look, how the black slave smiles upon the father,                120
    As who should say 'Old lad, I am thine own.'
    He is your brother, lords, sensibly fed
    Of that self-blood that first gave life to you;
    And from that womb where you imprison'd were[4543]
    He is enfranchised and come to light:                            125
    Nay, he is your brother by the surer side,[4544]
    Although my seal be stamped in his face.

    _Nur._ Aaron, what shall I say unto the empress?[4545]

    _Dem_. Advise thee, Aaron, what is to be done,
    And we will all subscribe to thy advice:[4546]                   130
    Save thou the child, so we may all be safe.[4547]

    _Aar._ Then sit we down, and let us all consult.
    My son and I will have the wind of you:
    Keep there: now talk at pleasure of your safety.  [_They sit._[4548]

    _Dem._ How many women saw this child of his?                     135

    _Aar._ Why, so, brave lords! when we join in league,[4549]
    I am a lamb: but if you brave the Moor,
    The chafed boar, the mountain lioness,
    The ocean swells not so as Aaron storms.[4550]
    But say, again, how many saw the child?[4551]                    140

    _Nur._ Cornelia the midwife and myself;
    And no one else but the deliver'd empress.[4552]

    _Aar._ The empress, the midwife, and yourself:
    Two may keep counsel when the third's away:[4553]
    Go to the empress, tell her this I said. [_He kills the Nurse._[4554]  145
    Weke, weke![4555]
    So cries a pig prepared to the spit.[4555][4556]

    _Dem._ What mean'st thou, Aaron? wherefore didst thou this?[4557]

    _Aar._ O Lord, sir, 'tis a deed of policy:
    Shall she live to betray this guilt of ours,                     150
    A long-tongued babbling gossip? no, lords, no:
    And now be it known to you my full intent.
    Not far, one Muliteus, my countryman,[4558]
    His wife but yesternight was brought to bed;
    His child is like to her, fair as you are:                       155
    Go pack with him, and give the mother gold,
    And tell them both the circumstance of all;
    And how by this their child shall be advanced,[4559]
    And be received for the emperor's heir,[4560]
    And substituted in the place of mine,                            160
    To calm this tempest whirling in the court;[4561]
    And let the emperor dandle him for his own.
    Hark ye, lords; you see I have given her physic,

                                         [_Pointing to the Nurse._[4562]

    And you must needs bestow her funeral;
    The fields are near, and you are gallant grooms:                 165
    This done, see that you take no longer days,[4563]
    But send the midwife presently to me.
    The midwife and the nurse well made away,
    Then let the ladies tattle what they please.[4564]

    _Chi._ Aaron, I see thou wilt not trust the air[4565]            170
    With secrets.[4565]

    _Dem._        For this care of Tamora,
    Herself and hers are highly bound to thee.

             [_Exeunt Dem. and Chi. bearing off the Nurse's body._[4566]

    _Aar._ Now to the Goths, as swift as swallow flies;
    There to dispose this treasure in mine arms,
    And secretly to greet the empress' friends.                      175
    Come on, you thick-lipp'd slave, I'll bear you hence;
    For it is you that puts us to our shifts:[4567]
    I'll make you feed on berries and on roots,[4568]
    And feed on curds and whey, and suck the goat,[4569]
    And cabin in a cave, and bring you up                            180
    To be a warrior and command a camp.                         [_Exit._


SCENE III. _The same. A public place._

    _Enter_ TITUS, _bearing arrows with letters at the ends of
        them; with him_, MARCUS, _young_ LUCIUS, _and other_
        Gentlemen (PUBLIUS, SEMPRONIUS, _and_ CAIUS), _with
        bows_.[4570]

    _Tit._ Come, Marcus, come; kinsmen, this is the way.[4571]
    Sir boy, let me see your archery;[4572]
    Look ye draw home enough, and 'tis there straight.
    Terras Astræa reliquit:[4573]
    Be you remember'd, Marcus, she's gone, she's fled.[4573][4574]     5
    Sirs, take you to your tools. You, cousins, shall[4573][4575]
    Go sound the ocean, and cast your nets;[4573]
    Happily you may catch her in the sea;[4573][4576]
    Yet there's as little justice as at land:
    No; Publius and Sempronius, you must do it;                       10
    'Tis you must dig with mattock and with spade,
    And pierce the inmost centre of the earth:
    Then, when you come to Pluto's region,
    I pray you, deliver him this petition;[4577]
    Tell him, it is for justice and for aid,                          15
    And that it comes from old Andronicus,
    Shaken with sorrows in ungrateful Rome.
    Ah, Rome! Well, well; I made thee miserable
    What time I threw the people's suffrages
    On him that thus doth tyrannize o'er me.                          20
    Go, get you gone; and pray be careful all,
    And leave you not a man-of-war unsearch'd:
    This wicked emperor may have shipp'd her hence;
    And, kinsmen, then we may go pipe for justice.

    _Marc._ O Publius, is not this a heavy case,                      25
    To see thy noble uncle thus distract?

    _Pub._ Therefore, my lord, it highly us concerns[4578][4579]
    By day and night to attend him carefully,
    And feed his humour kindly as we may,
    Till time beget some careful remedy.                              30

    _Marc._ Kinsmen, his sorrows are past remedy.[4580]
    Join with the Goths, and with revengeful war
    Take wreak on Rome for this ingratitude
    And vengeance on the traitor Saturnine.

    _Tit._ Publius, how now! how now, my masters![4581]               35
    What, have you met with her?[4581]

    _Pub._ No, my good lord; but Pluto sends you word,[4578]
    If you will have Revenge from hell, you shall:
    Marry, for Justice, she is so employ'd,[4582]
    He thinks, with Jove in heaven, or somewhere else,                40
    So that perforce you must needs stay a time.

    _Tit._ He doth me wrong to feed me with delays.
    I'll dive into the burning lake below,
    And pull her out of Acheron by the heels.[4583]
    Marcus, we are but shrubs, no cedars we,                          45
    No big-boned men framed of the Cyclops' size;
    But metal, Marcus, steel to the very back,
    Yet wrung with wrongs more than our backs can bear:[4584]
    And sith there's no justice in earth nor hell,[4585]
    We will solicit heaven, and move the gods                         50
    To send down Justice for to wreak our wrongs.
    Come, to this gear. You are a good archer, Marcus;[4586]

                                            [_He gives them the arrows._

    'Ad Jovem,' that's for you: here, 'Ad Apollinem:'[4587]
    'Ad Martem,' that's for myself:[4588]
    Here, boy, to Pallas: here, to Mercury:                           55
    To Saturn, Caius, not to Saturnine;[4589]
    You were as good to shoot against the wind.
    To it, boy! Marcus, loose when I bid.[4590]
    Of my word, I have written to effect;[4591]
    There's not a god left unsolicited.                               60

    _Marc._ Kinsmen, shoot all your shafts into the court:[4592]
    We will afflict the emperor in his pride.

    _Tit._ Now, masters, draw. [_They shoot._] O, well said, Lucius![4593]
    Good boy, in Virgo's lap; give it Pallas.[4594]

    _Marc._ My lord, I aim a mile beyond the moon;[4595]              65
    Your letter is with Jupiter by this.

    _Tit._ Ha, ha![4596]
    Publius, Publius, what hast thou done?[4596]
    See, see, thou hast shot off one of Taurus' horns.[4597]

    _Marc._ This was the sport, my lord: when Publius shot,           70
    The Bull, being gall'd, gave Aries such a knock
    That down fell both the Ram's horns in the court;
    And who should find them but the empress' villain?[4598]
    She laugh'd, and told the Moor he should not choose
    But give them to his master for a present.                        75

    _Tit._ Why, there it goes: God give his lordship joy![4599]

      _Enter a Clown, with a basket, and two pigeons in it._[4600]

    News, news from heaven! Marcus, the post is come.[4601]
    Sirrah, what tidings? have you any letters?
    Shall I have justice? what says Jupiter?

    _Clo._ O, the gibbet-maker! he says that he hath taken[4602]      80
    them down again, for the man must not be hanged till the
    next week.

    _Tit._ But what says Jupiter, I ask thee?[4603]

    _Clo._ Alas, sir, I know not Jupiter; I never drank with[4604][4605]
    him in all my life.[4604]                                         85

    _Tit._ Why, villain, art not thou the carrier?

    _Clo._ Ay, of my pigeons, sir; nothing else.[4606]

    _Tit._ Why, didst thou not come from heaven?

    _Clo._ From heaven! alas, sir, I never came there: God[4607]
    forbid I should be so bold to press to heaven in my young[4608]   90
    days. Why, I am going with my pigeons to the tribunal
    plebs, to take up a matter of brawl betwixt my uncle and
    one of the emperial's men.

    _Marc._ Why, sir, that is as fit as can be to serve for
    your oration; and let him deliver the pigeons to the              95
    emperor from you.

    _Tit._ Tell me, can you deliver an oration to the emperor
    with a grace?

    _Clo._ Nay, truly, sir, I could never say grace in all my life.

    _Tit._ Sirrah, come hither: make no more ado,                    100
    But give your pigeons to the emperor:
    By me thou shalt have justice at his hands.
    Hold, hold; meanwhile here's money for thy charges.[4609]
    Give me pen and ink.[4610]
    Sirrah, can you with a grace deliver a supplication?             105

    _Clo._ Ay, sir.

    _Tit._ Then here is a supplication for you. And when you
    come to him, at the first approach you must kneel; then kiss
    his foot; then deliver up your pigeons; and then look for
    your reward. I'll be at hand, sir; see you do it bravely.        110

    _Clo._ I warrant you, sir, let me alone.

    _Tit._ Sirrah, hast thou a knife? come, let me see it.
    Here, Marcus, fold it in the oration;
    For thou hast made it like an humble suppliant:
    And when thou hast given it to the emperor,[4611]                115
    Knock at my door, and tell me what he says.

    _Clo._ God be with you, sir; I will.                  [_Exit._[4612]

    _Tit._ Come, Marcus, let us go. Publius, follow me. [_Exeunt._[4613]


SCENE IV. _The same. Before the palace._

    _Enter_ SATURNINUS, TAMORA, CHIRON, DEMETRIUS, Lords, _and
        others_; SATURNINUS _with the Arrows in his hand that_
        TITUS _shot_.[4614]

    _Sat._ Why, lords, what wrongs are these! was ever seen[4615]
    An emperor in Rome thus overborne,[4616]
    Troubled, confronted thus, and for the extent
    Of egal justice used in such contempt?[4617]
    My lords, you know, as know the mightful gods,[4618]               5
    However these disturbers of our peace[4619]
    Buzz in the people's ears, there nought hath pass'd
    But even with law against the wilful sons[4620]
    Of old Andronicus. And what an if[4621]
    His sorrows have so overwhelm'd his wits,                         10
    Shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks,[4622]
    His fits, his frenzy and his bitterness?
    And now he writes to heaven for his redress:
    See, here's to Jove, and this to Mercury;
    This to Apollo; this to the god of war:                           15
    Sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Rome!
    What's this but libelling against the senate,[4623]
    And blazoning our unjustice every where?[4623][4624]
    A goodly humour, is it not, my lords?
    As who would say, in Rome no justice were.                        20
    But if I live, his feigned ecstasies[4625]
    Shall be no shelter to these outrages:
    But he and his shall know that justice lives
    In Saturninus' health; whom, if he sleep,[4626][4627]
    He'll so awake, as he in fury shall[4627]                         25
    Cut off the proud'st conspirator that lives.[4628]

    _Tam._ My gracious lord, my lovely Saturnine,[4629]
    Lord of my life, commander of my thoughts,[4630]
    Calm thee, and bear the faults of Titus' age,[4631]
    The effects of sorrow for his valiant sons,                       30
    Whose loss hath pierced him deep and scarr'd his heart;
    And rather comfort his distressed plight[4632]
    Than prosecute the meanest or the best
    For these contempts. [_Aside_] Why, thus it shall become[4633]
    High-witted Tamora to gloze with all:[4634]                       35
    But, Titus, I have touch'd thee to the quick,[4635]
    Thy life-blood out: if Aaron now be wise,[4635][4636]
    Then is all safe, the anchor in the port.[4637]

                             _Enter_ Clown.

    How now, good fellow! wouldst thou speak with us?

    _Clo._ Yea, forsooth, an your mistership be emperial.[4638]       40

    _Tam._ Empress I am, but yonder sits the emperor.

    _Clo._ 'Tis he. God and Saint Stephen give you god-den:[4639][4640]
    I have brought you a letter and a couple of pigeons[4639]
    here.                    [_Saturninus reads the letter._[4639][4641]

    _Sat._ Go, take him away, and hang him presently.[4642]           45

    _Clo._ How much money must I have?[4643]

    _Tam._ Come, sirrah, you must be hanged.[4644]

    _Clo._ Hanged! by'r lady, then I have brought up a neck[4645]
    to a fair end.                               [_Exit, guarded._[4646]

    _Sat._ Despiteful and intolerable wrongs!                         50
    Shall I endure this monstrous villany?
    I know from whence this same device proceeds:[4647]
    May this be borne? As if his traitorous sons,[4648]
    That died by law for murder of our brother,
    Have by my means been butcher'd wrongfully![4649]                 55
    Go, drag the villain hither by the hair;
    Nor age nor honour shall shape privilege:[4650]
    For this proud mock I'll be thy slaughter-man;
    Sly frantic wretch, that holp'st to make me great,
    In hope thyself should govern Rome and me.                        60

                         _Enter_ ÆMILIUS.[4651]

    What news with thee, Æmilius?[4652]

    _Æmil._ Arm, my lords; Rome never had more cause.[4653]
    The Goths have gather'd head, and with a power[4654]
    Of high-resolved men, bent to the spoil,
    They hither march amain, under conduct[4655]                      65
    Of Lucius, son to old Andronicus;
    Who threats, in course of this revenge, to do[4656]
    As much as ever Coriolanus did.

    _Sat._ Is warlike Lucius general of the Goths?[4657][4658]
    These tidings nip me, and I hang the head                         70
    As flowers with frost or grass beat down with storms:
    Ay, now begin our sorrows to approach:[4659]
    'Tis he the common people love so much;
    Myself hath often heard them say,[4660]
    When I have walked like a private man,                            75
    That Lucius' banishment was wrongfully,
    And they have wish'd that Lucius were their emperor.[4661]

    _Tam._ Why should you fear? is not your city strong?[4662]

    _Sat._ Ay, but the citizens favour Lucius,[4657]
    And will revolt from me to succour him.                           80

    _Tam._ King, be thy thoughts imperious, like thy name.
    Is the sun dimm'd, that gnats do fly in it?[4663]
    The eagle suffers little birds to sing,
    And is not careful what they mean thereby,
    Knowing that with the shadow of his wings[4664]                   85
    He can at pleasure stint their melody:
    Even so mayst thou the giddy men of Rome.[4665]
    Then cheer thy spirit: for know, thou emperor,
    I will enchant the old Andronicus
    With words more sweet, and yet more dangerous,                    90
    Than baits to fish, or honey-stalks to sheep;
    Whenas the one is wounded with the bait,
    The other rotted with delicious feed.[4666]

    _Sat._ But he will not entreat his son for us.[4657][4667]

    _Tam._ If Tamora entreat him, then he will:[4668]                 95
    For I can smooth, and fill his aged ears[4669]
    With golden promises; that, were his heart
    Almost impregnable, his old ears deaf,[4670]
    Yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue.
    [_To Æmilius_] Go thou before, be our ambassador:[4671]          100
    Say that the emperor requests a parley
    Of warlike Lucius, and appoint the meeting
    Even at his father's house, the old Andronicus.[4672]

    _Sat._ Æmilius, do this message honourably:[4657][4667]
    And if he stand on hostage for his safety,[4673]                 105
    Bid him demand what pledge will please him best.

    _Æmil._ Your bidding shall I do effectually.                [_Exit._

    _Tam._ Now will I to that old Andronicus,
    And temper him with all the art I have,[4674]
    To pluck proud Lucius from the warlike Goths.                    110
    And now, sweet emperor, be blithe again,
    And bury all thy fear in my devices.[4675]

    _Sat._ Then go successantly, and plead to him.      [_Exeunt._[4676]

ACT V.


SCENE I. _Plains near Rome._

  _Flourish. Enter_ LUCIUS _and_ Goths, _with drum and colours_.[4677]

    _Luc._ Approved warriors, and my faithful friends,
    I have received letters from great Rome,
    Which signify what hate they bear their emperor,[4678]
    And how desirous of our sight they are.
    Therefore, great lords, be, as your titles witness,                5
    Imperious, and impatient of your wrongs;
    And wherein Rome hath done you any scath,
    Let him make treble satisfaction.

    _First Goth._ Brave slip, sprung from the great Andronicus,[4679]
    Whose name was once our terror, now our comfort;                  10
    Whose high exploits and honourable deeds
    Ingrateful Rome requites with foul contempt,
    Be bold in us: we'll follow where thou lead'st,[4680]
    Like stinging bees in hottest summer's day,
    Led by their master to the flowered fields,[4681]                 15
    And be avenged on cursed Tamora.[4682]

    _All the Goths._ And as he saith, so say we all with him.[4683]

    _Luc._ I humbly thank him, and I thank you all.
    But who comes here, led by a lusty Goth?

 _Enter a_ Goth, _leading_ AARON _with his_ Child _in his arms_.[4684]

    _Sec. Goth._ Renowned Lucius, from our troops I stray'd[4685]     20
    To gaze upon a ruinous monastery;
    And, as I earnestly did fix mine eye
    Upon the wasted building, suddenly[4686]
    I heard a child cry underneath a wall.
    I made unto the noise; when soon I heard                          25
    The crying babe controll'd with this discourse:
    'Peace, tawny slave, half me and half thy dam!
    Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art,
    Had nature lent thee but thy mother's look,
    Villain, thou mightst have been an emperor:                       30
    But where the bull and cow are both milk-white,
    They never do beget a coal-black calf.
    Peace, villain, peace!'--even thus he rates the babe--
    'For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth;
    Who, when he knows thou art the empress' babe,                    35
    Will hold thee dearly for thy mother's sake.'
    With this, my weapon drawn, I rush'd upon him,
    Surprised him suddenly, and brought him hither,
    To use as you think needful of the man.

    _Luc._ O worthy Goth, this is the incarnate devil                 40
    That robb'd Andronicus of his good hand;
    This is the pearl that pleased your empress' eye;
    And here's the base fruit of his burning lust.[4687]
    Say, wall-eyed slave, whither wouldst thou convey[4688]
    This growing image of thy fiend-like face?[4689]                  45
    Why dost not speak? what, deaf? not a word?[4690]
    A halter, soldiers! hang him on this tree,
    And by his side his fruit of bastardy.

    _Aar._ Touch not the boy; he is of royal blood.

    _Luc._ Too like the sire for ever being good.                     50
    First hang the child, that he may see it sprawl;
    A sight to vex the father's soul withal.
    Get me a ladder.

               [_A ladder brought, which Aaron is made to ascend._[4691]

    _Aar._           Lucius, save the child,
    And bear it from me to the empress.
    If thou do this, I'll show thee wondrous things,                  55
    That highly may advantage thee to hear:
    If thou wilt not, befall what may befall,
    I'll speak no more but 'Vengeance rot you all!'[4692]

    _Luc._ Say on: an if it please me which thou speak'st,[4693]
    Thy child shall live, and I will see it nourish'd.                60

    _Aar._ An if it please thee! why, assure thee, Lucius,[4694]
    'Twill vex thy soul to hear what I shall speak;
    For I must talk of murders, rapes and massacres,
    Acts of black night, abominable deeds,[4695]
    Complots of mischief, treason, villanies[4696]                    65
    Ruthful to hear, yet piteously perform'd:[4697]
    And this shall all be buried in my death,[4698]
    Unless thou swear to me my child shall live.

    _Luc._ Tell on thy mind; I say thy child shall live.[4699]

    _Aar._ Swear that he shall, and then I will begin.                70

    _Luc._ Who should I swear by? thou believest no god:[4700]
    That granted, how canst thou believe an oath?[4701]

    _Aar._ What if I do not? as, indeed, I do not;[4702]
    Yet, for I know thou art religious
    And hast a thing within thee called conscience,                   75
    With twenty popish tricks and ceremonies,
    Which I have seen thee careful to observe,
    Therefore I urge thy oath; for that I know[4703]
    An idiot holds his bauble for a god,[4703]
    And keeps the oath which by that god he swears,[4703]             80
    To that I'll urge him: therefore thou shalt vow[4703]
    By that same god, what god soe'er it be,
    That thou adorest and hast in reverence,
    To save my boy, to nourish and bring him up;[4704]
    Or else I will discover nought to thee.[4705]                     85

    _Luc._ Even by my god I swear to thee I will.[4706]

    _Aar._ First know thou, I begot him on the empress.[4707]

    _Luc._ O most insatiate, and luxurious woman![4708]

    _Aar._ Tut, Lucius, this was but a deed of charity
    To that which thou shalt hear of me anon.                         90
    'Twas her two sons that murder'd Bassianus;[4709]
    They cut thy sister's tongue, and ravish'd her,
    And cut her hands, and trimm'd her as thou saw'st.[4710]

    _Luc._ O detestable villain! call'st thou that trimming?[4711][4712]

    _Aar._ Why, she was wash'd and cut and trimm'd, and 'twas[4711]   95
    Trim sport for them that had the doing of it.[4711][4713]

    _Luc._ O barbarous, beastly villains, like thyself!

    _Aar._ Indeed, I was their tutor to instruct them:
    That codding spirit had they from their mother,
    As sure a card as ever won the set;                              100
    That bloody mind, I think, they learn'd of me,
    As true a dog as ever fought at head.
    Well, let my deeds be witness of my worth.
    I train'd thy brethren to that guileful hole,
    Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay:                          105
    I wrote the letter that thy father found,
    And hid the gold within the letter mention'd,
    Confederate with the queen and her two sons:
    And what not done, that thou hast cause to rue,
    Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it?[4714]                 110
    I play'd the cheater for thy father's hand;
    And, when I had it, drew myself apart,[4715]
    And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter:
    I pried me through the crevice of a wall[4716]
    When for his hand he had his two sons' heads;                    115
    Beheld his tears and laugh'd so heartily,
    That both mine eyes were rainy like to his:
    And when I told the empress of this sport,
    She swounded almost at my pleasing tale,[4717]
    And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses.                        120

    _First Goth._ What, canst thou say all this, and never blush?[4679]

    _Aar._ Ay, like a black dog, as the saying is.[4718]

    _Luc._ Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds?

    _Aar._ Ay, that I had not done a thousand more.
    Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,                      125
    Few come within the compass of my curse--[4719]
    Wherein I did not some notorious ill:
    As kill a man, or else devise his death;
    Ravish a maid, or plot the way to do it;
    Accuse some innocent, and forswear myself;[4720]                 130
    Set deadly enmity between two friends;
    Make poor men's cattle break their necks;[4721]
    Set fire on barns and hay-stacks in the night
    And bid the owners quench them with their tears.[4722]
    Oft have I digg'd up dead men from their graves,                 135
    And set them upright at their dear friends' doors,[4723]
    Even when their sorrows almost were forgot;[4724]
    And on their skins, as on the bark of trees,
    Have with my knife carved in Roman letters
    'Let not your sorrow die, though I am dead.'                     140
    Tut, I have done a thousand dreadful things
    As willingly as one would kill a fly;
    And nothing grieves me heartily indeed,
    But that I cannot do ten thousand more.

    _Luc._ Bring down the devil; for he must not die                 145
    So sweet a death as hanging presently.

    _Aar._ If there be devils, would I were a devil,
    To live and burn in everlasting fire,
    So I might have your company in hell,
    But to torment you with my bitter tongue!                        150

    _Luc._ Sirs, stop his mouth, and let him speak no more.

                         _Enter a_ Goth.[4725]

    _Third Goth._ My lord, there is a messenger from Rome[4726]
    Desires to be admitted to your presence.

    _Luc._ Let him come near.

                         _Enter_ ÆMILIUS.[4727]

    Welcome, Æmilius: what's the news from Rome?[4728]               155

    _Æmil._ Lord Lucius, and you princes of the Goths,
    The Roman emperor greets you all by me;
    And, for he understands you are in arms,
    He craves a parley at your father's house,
    Willing you to demand your hostages,                             160
    And they shall be immediately deliver'd.[4729]

    _First Goth._ What says our general?[4679]

    _Luc._ Æmilius, let the emperor give his pledges
    Unto my father and my uncle Marcus,
    And we will come. March away.        [_Flourish. Exeunt._[4730]  165


SCENE II. _Rome. Before Titus's house._

      _Enter_ TAMORA, DEMETRIUS, _and_ CHIRON, _disguised_.[4731]

    _Tam._ Thus, in this strange and sad habiliment,[4732]
    I will encounter with Andronicus,
    And say I am Revenge, sent from below
    To join with him and right his heinous wrongs.
    Knock at his study, where, they say, he keeps,[4733]               5
    To ruminate strange plots of dire revenge;
    Tell him Revenge is come to join with him,
    And work confusion on his enemies.              [_They knock._[4734]

                        _Enter_ TITUS, _above_.

    _Tit._ Who doth molest my contemplation?
    Is it your trick to make me ope the door,                         10
    That so my sad decrees may fly away,
    And all my study be to no effect?[4735]
    You are deceived: for what I mean to do
    See here in bloody lines I have set down;
    And what is written shall be executed.                            15

    _Tam._ Titus, I am come to talk with thee.[4736]

    _Tit._ No, not a word: how can I grace my talk,
    Wanting a hand to give it action?[4737]
    Thou hast the odds of me; therefore no more.

    _Tam._ If thou didst know me, thou wouldst talk with me.[4738]    20

    _Tit._ I am not mad; I know thee well enough:
    Witness this wretched stump, witness these crimson lines;[4739]
    Witness these trenches made by grief and care;
    Witness the tiring day and heavy night;
    Witness all sorrow, that I know thee well                         25
    For our proud empress, mighty Tamora:
    Is not thy coming for my other hand?[4740]

    _Tam._ Know, thou sad man, I am not Tamora;[4741]
    She is thy enemy, and I thy friend:
    I am Revenge; sent from the infernal kingdom,                     30
    To ease the gnawing vulture of thy mind,[4742]
    By working wreakful vengeance on thy foes.[4743]
    Come down and welcome me to this world's light;
    Confer with me of murder and of death:
    There's not a hollow cave or lurking-place,                       35
    No vast obscurity or misty vale,
    Where bloody murder or detested rape
    Can couch for fear, but I will find them out,
    And in their ears tell them my dreadful name,
    Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.[4744]               40

    _Tit._ Art thou Revenge? and art thou sent to me,
    To be a torment to mine enemies?[4745]

    _Tam._ I am; therefore come down and welcome me.[4746]

    _Tit._ Do me some service ere I come to thee.
    Lo, by thy side where Rape and Murder stands;[4747]               45
    Now give some surance that thou art Revenge,[4748]
    Stab them, or tear them on thy chariot-wheels;
    And then I'll come and be thy waggoner,
    And whirl along with thee about the globes.[4749]
    Provide thee two proper palfreys, black as jet,[4750]             50
    To hale thy vengeful waggon swift away,
    And find out murderers in their guilty caves:[4751]
    And when thy car is loaden with their heads,
    I will dismount, and by the waggon-wheel[4752]
    Trot like a servile footman all day long,                         55
    Even from Hyperion's rising in the east[4753]
    Until his very downfall in the sea:
    And day by day I'll do this heavy task,
    So thou destroy Rapine and Murder there.

    _Tam._ These are my ministers and come with me.[4754]             60

    _Tit._ Are these thy ministers? what are they call'd?

    _Tam._ Rapine and Murder; therefore called so,[4755]
    'Cause they take vengeance of such kind of men.[4756]

    _Tit._ Good Lord, how like the empress' sons they are,
    And you the empress! but we worldly men                           65
    Have miserable, mad, mistaking eyes.[4757]
    O sweet Revenge, now do I come to thee;
    And, if one arm's embracement will content thee,
    I will embrace thee in it by and by.            [_Exit above._[4758]

    _Tam._ This closing with him fits his lunacy:                     70
    Whate'er I forge to feed his brain-sick fits,
    Do you uphold and maintain in your speeches,[4759]
    For now he firmly takes me for Revenge;
    And, being credulous in this mad thought,
    I'll make him send for Lucius his son;                            75
    And, whilst I at a banquet hold him sure,
    I'll find some cunning practice out of hand,
    To scatter and disperse the giddy Goths,
    Or at the least make them his enemies.
    See, here he comes, and I must ply my theme.                      80

                     _Enter_ TITUS, _below_.[4760]

    _Tit._ Long have I been forlorn, and all for thee:[4761]
    Welcome, dread Fury, to my woful house:
    Rapine and Murder, you are welcome too:
    How like the empress and her sons you are!
    Well are you fitted, had you but a Moor:                          85
    Could not all hell afford you such a devil?
    For well I wot the empress never wags
    But in her company there is a Moor;
    And, would you represent our queen aright,
    It were convenient you had such a devil:                          90
    But welcome, as you are. What shall we do?

    _Tam._ What wouldst them have us do, Andronicus?

    _Dem._ Show me a murderer, I'll deal with him.

    _Chi._ Show me a villain that hath done a rape,
    And I am sent to be revenged on him.                              95

    _Tam._ Show me a thousand that have done thee wrong,
    And I will be revenged on them all.[4762]

    _Tit._ Look round about the wicked streets of Rome,
    And when thou find'st a man that's like thyself,
    Good Murder, stab him; he's a murderer.                          100
    Go thou with him, and when it is thy hap
    To find another that is like to thee,
    Good Rapine, stab him; he's a ravisher.[4763]
    Go thou with them; and in the emperor's court
    There is a queen, attended by a Moor;                            105
    Well mayst thou know her by thine own proportion,[4764]
    For up and down she doth resemble thee:
    I pray thee, do on them some violent death;
    They have been violent to me and mine.

    _Tam._ Well hast thou lesson'd us; this shall we do.             110
    But would it please thee, good Andronicus,[4765]
    To send for Lucius, thy thrice valiant son,
    Who leads towards Rome a band of warlike Goths,
    And bid him come and banquet at thy house;
    When he is here, even at thy solemn feast,                       115
    I will bring in the empress and her sons,
    The emperor himself, and all thy foes;
    And at thy mercy shall they stoop and kneel,
    And on them shalt thou ease thy angry heart.
    What says Andronicus to this device?[4766]                       120

    _Tit._ Marcus, my brother! 'tis sad Titus calls.

                         _Enter_ MARCUS.[4767]

    Go, gentle Marcus, to thy nephew Lucius;
    Thou shalt inquire him out among the Goths:
    Bid him repair to me and bring with him
    Some of the chiefest princes of the Goths:                       125
    Bid him encamp his soldiers where they are:
    Tell him the emperor and the empress too
    Feast at my house, and he shall feast with them.[4768]
    This do thou for my love, and so let him,
    As he regards his aged father's life.                            130

    _Marc._ This will I do, and soon return again.        [_Exit._[4769]

    _Tam._ Now will I hence about thy business,
    And take my ministers along with me.

    _Tit._ Nay, nay, let Rape and Murder stay with me;
    Or else I'll call my brother back again,                         135
    And cleave to no revenge but Lucius.[4770]

    _Tam._ [_Aside to her sons_] What say you, boys? will
              you bide with him,[4771]
    Whiles I go tell my lord the emperor
    How I have govern'd our determined jest?
    Yield to his humour, smooth and speak him fair,[4772]            140
    And tarry with him till I turn again.[4773]

    _Tit._ [_Aside_] I know them all, though they suppose me mad;[4774]
    And will o'er-reach them in their own devices:[4775]
    A pair of cursed hell-hounds and their dam.[4776]

    _Dem._ Madam, depart at pleasure; leave us here.                 145

    _Tam._ Farewell, Andronicus: Revenge now goes
    To lay a complot to betray thy foes.

    _Tit._ I know thou dost; and, sweet Revenge, farewell.

                                                  [_Exit Tamora._[4777]

    _Chi._ Tell us, old man, how shall we be employ'd?

    _Tit._ Tut, I have work enough for you to do.[4778]              150
    Publius, come hither, Caius, and Valentine!

                  _Enter_ PUBLIUS _and others_.[4779]

    _Pub._ What is your will?[4780]

    _Tit._ Know you these two?[4781]

    _Pub._ The empress' sons, I take them, Chiron and[4779][4782][4783]
    Demetrius.[4783]                                                 155

    _Tit._ Fie, Publius, fie! thou art too much deceived;
    The one is Murder, Rape is the other's name;
    And therefore bind them, gentle Publius:
    Caius and Valentine, lay hands on them:
    Oft have you heard me wish for such an hour,                     160
    And now I find it; therefore bind them sure;
    And stop their mouths, if they begin to cry.                [_Exit._

                 [_Publius, &c. lay hold on Chiron and Demetrius._[4784]

    _Chi._ Villains, forbear! we are the empress' sons.

    _Pub._ And therefore do we what we are commanded.[4779]
    Stop close their mouths, let them not speak a word.              165
    Is he sure bound? look that you bind them fast.

    _Re-enter_ TITUS, _with_ LAVINIA; _he bearing a knife, and she a
                             basin_.[4785]

    _Tit._ Come, come, Lavinia; look, thy foes are bound.[4786]
    Sirs, stop their mouths, let them not speak to me;
    But let them hear what fearful words I utter.
    O villains, Chiron and Demetrius!                                170
    Here stands the spring whom you have stain'd with mud,
    This goodly summer with your winter mix'd.
    You kill'd her husband, and for that vile fault[4787]
    Two of her brothers were condemn'd to death,
    My hand cut off and made a merry jest;                           175
    Both her sweet hands, her tongue, and that more dear
    Than hands or tongue, her spotless chastity,
    Inhuman traitors, you constrain'd and forced.
    What would you say, if I should let you speak?[4788]
    Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.                 180
    Hark, wretches! how I mean to martyr you.
    This one hand yet is left to cut your throats,[4789]
    Whilst that Lavinia 'tween her stumps doth hold[4790]
    The basin that receives your guilty blood.
    You know your mother means to feast with me,[4791]               185
    And calls herself Revenge, and thinks me mad:
    Hark, villains! I will grind your bones to dust,
    And with your blood and it I'll make a paste;
    And of the paste a coffin I will rear,[4792]
    And make two pasties of your shameful heads;                     190
    And bid that strumpet, your unhallow'd dam,[4793]
    Like to the earth, swallow her own increase.[4794]
    This is the feast that I have bid her to,
    And this the banquet she shall surfeit on;
    For worse than Philomel you used my daughter,                    195
    And worse than Progne I will be revenged:[4795]
    And now prepare your throats. Lavinia, come,

                                         [_He cuts their throats._[4796]

    Receive the blood: and when that they are dead,
    Let me go grind their bones to powder small,
    And with this hateful liquor temper it;                          200
    And in that paste let their vile heads be baked.[4797]
    Come, come, be every one officious[4798]
    To make this banquet; which I wish may prove[4799]
    More stern and bloody than the Centaurs' feast.[4800]
    So, now bring them in, for I'll play the cook,[4801]             205
    And see them ready against their mother comes.

                               [_Exeunt, bearing the dead bodies._[4802]


SCENE III. _Court of Titus's house. A banquet set out._

  _Enter_ LUCIUS, MARCUS, _and_ Goths, _with_ AARON, _prisoner_.[4803]

    _Luc._ Uncle Marcus, since it is my father's mind[4804]
    That I repair to Rome, I am content.

    _First Goth._ And ours with thine, befall what fortune will.[4805]

    _Luc._ Good uncle, take you in this barbarous Moor,
    This ravenous tiger, this accursed devil;                          5
    Let him receive no sustenance, fetter him,[4806]
    Till he be brought unto the empress' face,[4807]
    For testimony of her foul proceedings:[4808]
    And see the ambush of our friends be strong;
    I fear the emperor means no good to us.[4809]                     10

    _Aar._ Some devil whisper curses in mine ear,[4810]
    And prompt me, that my tongue may utter forth
    The venomous malice of my swelling heart!

    _Luc._ Away, inhuman dog! unhallow'd slave![4811]
    Sirs, help our uncle to convey him in.                            15

                     [_Exeunt Goths, with Aaron. Flourish within._[4812]

    The trumpets show the emperor is at hand.

       _Enter_ SATURNINUS _and_ TAMORA, _with_ ÆMILIUS, Tribunes,
                     Senators, _and others_.[4813]

    _Sat._ What, hath the firmament moe suns than one?[4814]

    _Luc._ What boots it thee to call thyself a sun?[4815]

    _Marc._ Rome's emperor, and nephew, break the parle;[4816]
    These quarrels must be quietly debated.                           20
    The feast is ready, which the careful Titus
    Hath ordain'd to an honourable end,[4817]
    For peace, for love, for league and good to Rome:
    Please you, therefore, draw nigh, and take your places.

    _Sat._ Marcus, we will.       25

                      [_Hautboys sound. The Company sit down at table._

      _Enter_ TITUS, _like a Cook, placing the meat on the table,
     and_ LAVINIA _with a veil over her face, young_ LUCIUS, _and
                            others_.[4818]

    _Tit._ Welcome, my gracious lord; welcome, dread queen;[4819]
    Welcome, ye warlike Goths; welcome, Lucius;[4820]
    And welcome, all: although the cheer be poor,
    'Twill fill your stomachs; please you eat of it.

    _Sat._ Why art thou thus attired, Andronicus?[4821]               30

    _Tit._ Because I would be sure to have all well,
    To entertain your highness and your empress.

    _Tam._ We are beholding to you, good Andronicus.[4822]

    _Tit._ An if your highness knew my heart, you were.[4823]
    My lord the emperor, resolve me this:                             35
    Was it well done of rash Virginius
    To slay his daughter with his own right hand,
    Because she was enforced, stain'd, and deflower'd?

    _Sat._ It was, Andronicus.[4821]

    _Tit._ Your reason, mighty lord?[4824]                            40

    _Sat._ Because the girl should not survive her shame,[4821]
    And by her presence still renew his sorrows.

    _Tit._ A reason mighty, strong and effectual,[4825]
    A pattern, precedent, and lively warrant,[4826]
    For me, most wretched, to perform the like.                       45
    Die, die, Lavinia, and thy shame with thee,
    And with thy shame thy father's sorrow die!  [_Kills Lavinia._[4827]

    _Sat._ What hast thou done, unnatural and unkind?[4821][4828]

    _Tit._ Kill'd her, for whom my tears have made me blind.
    I am as woful as Virginius was,                                   50
    And have a thousand times more cause than he
    To do this outrage, and it now is done.[4829]

    _Sat._ What, was she ravish'd? tell who did the deed.[4830]

    _Tit._ Will't please you eat? will't please your highness feed?[4831]

    _Tam._ Why hast thou slain thine only daughter thus?[4832]        55

    _Tit._ Not I; 'twas Chiron and Demetrius:
    They ravish'd her, and cut away her tongue;
    And they, 'twas they, that did her all this wrong.

    _Sat._ Go fetch them hither to us presently.[4821][4833]

    _Tit._ Why, there they are both, baked in that pie;               60
    Whereof their mother daintily hath fed,
    Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.
    'Tis true, 'tis true; witness my knife's sharp point.

                                                 [_Kills Tamora._[4834]

    _Sat._ Die, frantic wretch, for this accursed deed!

                                                  [_Kills Titus._[4835]

    _Luc._ Can the son's eye behold his father bleed?                 65
    There's meed for meed, death for a deadly deed!

                            [_Kills Saturninus. A great tumult. Lucius,
                      Marcus, and others go up into the balcony._[4836]

    _Marc._ You sad-faced men, people and sons of Rome,
    By uproars sever'd, as a flight of fowl[4837]
    Scatter'd by winds and high tempestuous gusts,[4838]
    O, let me teach you how to knit again[4839]                       70
    This scatter'd corn into one mutual sheaf,
    These broken limbs again into one body;[4840]
    Lest Rome herself be bane unto herself,[4840]
    And she whom mighty kingdoms court'sy to,[4841]
    Like a forlorn and desperate castaway,[4842]                      75
    Do shameful execution on herself.
    But if my frosty signs and chaps of age,[4843]
    Grave witnesses of true experience,
    Cannot induce you to attend my words,--
    [_To Lucius_] Speak, Rome's dear friend: as erst our ancestor,[4844]  80
    When with his solemn tongue he did discourse
    To love-sick Dido's sad attending ear
    The story of that baleful burning night[4845]
    When subtle Greeks surprised King Priam's Troy;
    Tell us what Sinon hath bewitch'd our ears,                       85
    Or who hath brought the fatal engine in
    That gives our Troy, our Rome, the civil wound.
    My heart is not compact of flint nor steel;
    Nor can I utter all our bitter grief,
    But floods of tears will drown my oratory,                        90
    And break my utterance, even in the time[4846]
    When it should move you to attend me most,
    Lending your kind commiseration.[4847]
    Here is a captain, let him tell the tale;[4848]
    Your hearts will throb and weep to hear him speak.                95

    _Luc._ Then, noble auditory, be it known to you,[4849]
    That cursed Chiron and Demetrius
    Were they that murdered our emperor's brother;[4850]
    And they it were that ravished our sister:[4851]
    For their fell faults our brothers were beheaded,                100
    Our father's tears despised, and basely cozen'd
    Of that true hand that fought Rome's quarrel out
    And sent her enemies unto the grave.[4852]
    Lastly, myself unkindly banished,
    The gates shut on me, and turn'd weeping out,                    105
    To beg relief among Rome's enemies;
    Who drown'd their enmity in my true tears,
    And oped their arms to embrace me as a friend.
    I am the turned forth, be it known to you,[4853]
    That have preserved her welfare in my blood,                     110
    And from her bosom took the enemy's point,
    Sheathing the steel in my adventurous body.
    Alas, you know I am no vaunter, I;
    My scars can witness, dumb although they are,
    That my report is just and full of truth.                        115
    But, soft! methinks I do digress too much,
    Citing my worthless praise: O, pardon me;
    For when no friends are by, men praise themselves.

    _Marc._ Now is my turn to speak. Behold the child:

             [_Pointing to the Child in the arms of an Attendant._[4854]

    Of this was Tamora delivered;                                    120
    The issue of an irreligious Moor,
    Chief architect and plotter of these woes:
    The villain is alive in Titus' house,
    And as he is, to witness this is true.[4855]
    Now judge what cause had Titus to revenge[4856]                  125
    These wrongs, unspeakable, past patience,
    Or more than any living man could bear.
    Now you have heard the truth, what say you, Romans?
    Have we done aught amiss, show us wherein,[4857]
    And, from the place where you behold us now,                     130
    The poor remainder of Andronici[4858]
    Will, hand in hand, all headlong cast us down[4859]
    And on the ragged stones beat forth our brains[4860]
    And make a mutual closure of our house.
    Speak, Romans, speak, and if you say we shall,                   135
    Lo, hand in hand, Lucius and I will fall.

    _Æmil._ Come, come, thou reverend man of Rome,[4861]
    And bring our emperor gently in thy hand,
    Lucius our emperor; for well I know
    The common voice do cry it shall be so.[4862]                    140

    _All._ Lucius, all hail, Rome's royal emperor![4863]

    _Marc._ Go, go into old Titus' sorrowful house, [_To Attendants._[4864]
    And hither hale that misbelieving Moor,
    To be adjudged some direful slaughtering death,[4865]
    As punishment for his most wicked life.   [_Exeunt Attendants._  145

            _LUCIUS, MARCUS, and the others descend._[4866]

    _All._ Lucius, all hail, Rome's gracious governor![4867]

    _Luc._ Thanks, gentle Romans: may I govern so,
    To heal Rome's harms and wipe away her woe![4868]
    But, gentle people, give me aim awhile,[4869]
    For nature puts me to a heavy task;[4870]                        150
    Stand all aloof; but, uncle, draw you near,
    To shed obsequious tears upon this trunk.[4871]
    O, take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips, [_Kissing Titus._[4872]
    These sorrowful drops upon thy blood-stain'd face,[4873]
    The last true duties of thy noble son!                           155

    _Marc._ Tear for tear and loving kiss for kiss[4874]
    Thy brother Marcus tenders on thy lips:
    O, were the sum of these that I should pay
    Countless and infinite, yet would I pay them!

    _Luc._ Come hither, boy; come, come, and learn of us             160
    To melt in showers: thy grandsire loved thee well:
    Many a time he danced thee on his knee,
    Sung thee asleep, his loving breast thy pillow;
    Many a matter hath he told to thee,
    Meet and agreeing with thine infancy;[4875]                      165
    In that respect then, like a loving child,
    Shed yet some small drops from thy tender spring,
    Because kind nature doth require it so:
    Friends should associate friends in grief and woe:
    Bid him farewell; commit him to the grave;                       170
    Do him that kindness, and take leave of him.[4876]

    _Boy._ O grandsire, grandsire! even with all my heart[4877]
    Would I were dead, so you did live again!
    O Lord, I cannot speak to him for weeping;
    My tears will choke me, if I ope my mouth.                       175

                _Re-enter_ Attendants with AARON.[4878]

    _A Roman._ You sad Andronici, have done with woes:[4879]
    Give sentence on this execrable wretch
    That hath been breeder of these dire events.

    _Luc._ Set him breast-deep in earth, and famish him;
    There let him stand and rave and cry for food:                   180
    If any one relieves or pities him,
    For the offence he dies. This is our doom:
    Some stay to see him fasten'd in the earth.

    _Aar._ O, why should wrath be mute, and fury dumb?[4880]
    I am no baby, I, that with base prayers                          185
    I should repent the evils I have done:[4881]
    Ten thousand worse than ever yet I did
    Would I perform, if I might have my will:
    If one good deed in all my life I did,
    I do repent it from my very soul.                                190

    _Luc._ Some loving friends convey the emperor hence,[4882]
    And give him burial in his father's grave:[4883]
    My father and Lavinia shall forthwith
    Be closed in our household's monument.
    As for that heinous tiger, Tamora,[4884]                         195
    No funeral rite, nor man in mourning weeds,[4885]
    No mournful bell shall ring her burial;[4886]
    But throw her forth to beasts and birds of prey:[4887]
    Her life was beastly and devoid of pity,[4888]
    And, being so, shall have like want of pity.[4889]               200
    See justice done on Aaron, that damn'd Moor,[4890]
    By whom our heavy haps had their beginning:[4891]
    Then, afterwards, to order well the state,[4892]
    That like events may ne'er it ruinate.              [_Exeunt._[4893]

NOTES.


NOTE I.

II. 1. The Quartos have no distinction of act or scene here or
elsewhere. After _Exeunt_ comes immediately a stage direction _Sound
Trumpets, manet Moore._ The first Folio, after _Actus Secunda_, has
_Flourish. Enter Aaron alone._ The Editor of the second Folio seeing
the impropriety of introducing Aaron alone with a flourish of trumpets,
omitted the word _Flourish._ Capell was doubtless right in supposing
that it had been displaced from the end of the last scene.

Johnson is of opinion that this scene ought to continue the first act.


NOTE II.

II. 1. 134. Mr Collier, reading 'these,' says, 'The Quartos give the
text correctly.' The Quarto of 1611 has 'their.'


NOTE III.

III. 1. 170. In the copy of Theobald's edition before us, which
belonged to Warburton, the latter has written 'Mr Warburton' opposite
Theobald's note in defence of his emendation, thereby claiming for
himself the merit of the conjecture. But in his own edition he retains
the old reading 'castle,' while in a note he assigns the emendation to
Theobald, and ridicules him for adopting it. Theobald first proposed it
in a letter to Concanen (Nichols' _Illustrations_, II. 220).


NOTE IV.

III. 1. 277, 278. Perhaps the original MS. had as follows:

    'And thou, Lavinia, shalt be imployd,
    Beare thou my hand sweet wench betweene thy teeth.'

The Author, or some other corrector, to soften what must have been
ludicrous in representation, wrote 'Armes' above 'teeth' as a
substitute for the latter. The printer of the first Quarto took 'Armes'
to belong to the first line, and conjecturally filled up the lacuna
with 'in these,' making, also, an accidental alteration in the position
of 'thou.' Then a corrector of the second Quarto, from which the first
folio was printed, made sense of the passage by substituting 'things'
for 'Armes.'


NOTE V.

    III. 2. 81. The first Folio has: '_An._ Come, take away:'
                The second:           'And: Come take away:'
                The third and fourth: 'And, Come, take away;'

thus continuing the speech to Marcus. Rowe omitted 'And,' and the true
reading was not restored before Capell.

Mr Collier, in his second edition, says: 'In the Folio of the Earl of
Ellesmere, this speech has no prefix; but the conjunction 'And' for
_And._ was mistakenly put before 'Come.'' Mr Staunton however tells us
that there is a full stop after 'And,' and that though not in italics
the word is clearly meant for _Andronicus_.


NOTE VI.

IV. 1. 46. Mr Dyce says that Theobald omitted the words 'Help her:' but
this is a mistake. They are retained by Theobald, and by every other
editor we know of.


NOTE VII.

IV. 2. 100. 'Seems' is an error of Johnson's own printer. In his note
on the passage, he conjectures that 'scorns' is the true reading,
without knowing that it was to be found in every edition previous to
his own. For an instance of similar carelessness, see Note VI. to _The
Third Part of King Henry VI._


NOTE VIII.

IV. 2. 178. Mr Collier, in his Appendix to Coleridge's Lectures, states
that his MS. corrector substitutes 'thrive' for 'feed' in this line,
while, in the note to his second edition of Shakespeare, he says that
the substitution is made in the next line, '_thrive_ on curds, &c.'

In IV. 4. 37, we have assigned a reading to the MS. corrector, because
we find it in Mr Collier's one-volume edition, though he has not
mentioned it elsewhere.

In IV. 4. 113, he gives, in the Appendix to Coleridge's Lectures,
and in his second edition of Shakespeare, 'Then go _incessantly_,
and plead 'fore him,' as the reading of the MS. corrector, while in
the one-volume edition, he gives, on the same authority, 'Then go
_successfully_, and plead 'fore him.' We have left unnoticed other
discrepancies, where, as is usually the case, they were unimportant
to the sense. We mention the fact once for all, in order to defend
ourselves from the charge of inaccuracy. Indeed, it is on this ground
alone that we ever call attention to those errors of our predecessors,
which are, in themselves, venial and unimportant.


NOTE IX.

IV. 4. 8. Steevens says that the first Folio here has 'the law.' It is
'law' in every copy which we have been able to consult.


NOTE X.

V. 3. 72, 73. Mr Collier mentions that the correction 'Lest' for 'Let'
was also made by Southerne in his copy of the fourth Folio. The further
correction, which is due to Capell, was claimed by Steevens, and is
frequently given to him by modern editors. The corruption was perhaps
due to a copyist or printer, who, not seeing that 'Let' was miswritten
for 'Lest,' yet felt that the words 'Let Rome, &c.' were not suitable
to Marcus, and gave them to a Roman lord, at a guess. The Editor of
the first Folio, or some corrector of the Quarto from which he printed,
thinking the words not suitable to a Roman, gave them to a _Goth_.

It may be however that the four lines 'Let Rome ... herself' were
intended to be spoken by a Roman lord after Marcus had stabbed the
Emperor. Perhaps they were an after-thought of the author and written
at the foot of the page, and the printer of the first Quarto, thus
misled, inserted them in the middle of Marcus's speech.

In so doubtful a case we have acquiesced in what may be considered the
received text.

              CAMBRIDGE: PRINTED AT THE UNIVERSITY PRESS.





    Transcriber's Notes:


    P. xiii added Erratum corrections to text.

    Retained line wrapping in plays to retain prose numbering.

    Converted linenotes to footnotes with anchors at line ends.

    Retained incorrect line numbers, e.g. there are often more than
    5 lines (or occasionally less than 5) between increments of 5.

    Anchors assigned to linenotes without line references.

    Silently corrected simple spelling, grammar, and typographical
    errors.

    Retained anachronistic and non-standard spellings as printed.

    Enclosed italics markup in _underscores_.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is

contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
